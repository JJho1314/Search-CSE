I know that Philip Of Ibelin's mother was Isabella of Tripoli, and she was the daughter of Raymond III of Tripoli and Agnes of Montferrat. Agnes of Montferrat was the daughter of Amalric I of Jerusalem and Maria Komnene, a Byzantine princess. This historical context suggests a strong connection to the Byzantine Empire.
