You can search as many times as you want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: What nationality is Philip Of Ibelin (1180–1227)'s mother?\n\nIMPORTANT: Your previous attempt gave a WRONG answer. The previous attempt is shown below.\nYou MUST NOT repeat the same wrong answer. The answer shown below is INCORRECT.\nTry completely different search queries and reasoning to find the correct answer.\n\n### SOURCE TRAJECTORY SUMMARY\n  iter1_sol8\n  label: iter1_sol8\n  solution:\n  ```\n  <think>Given that Philip Of Ibelin (1180–1227) was a Crusader noble, his mother Isabella of Tripoli was also a noble.

Therefore, her nationality is Byzantine.</think>\n  <answer>Byzantine</answer>\n  ```\n  metric: 1.0\n  summary:\n    solution_name: multi_hop_v2\n    approach_summary: The agent used a multi-hop reasoning approach to gather information about Philip Of Ibelin's mother, Isabella of Tripoli. After verifying that Isabella of Tripoli was a Byzantine noblewoman through a direct search, the agent concluded that her nationality was Byzantine. The agent refined the search to confirm the exact nationality, leading to the correct answer without repeating the previous wrong answer.\n    search_queries:\n      - nationality of Isabella of Tripoli\n    reasoning_quality: Logical and refined. The agent correctly identified the need to verify Isabella of Tripoli's nationality and conducted a specific search to confirm it. The reasoning chain considered the historical context and the specific term used in the ground truth.\n    answer_quality: The final answer 'Byzantine' directly addresses the question and matches the ground truth.\n    key_learnings:\n      - Careful consideration of historical context and precise terminology is crucial for answering questions about historical figures.\n      - Multi-hop reasoning is effective but requires validation steps to ensure the specificity of the answer aligns with the question.\n      - Directly searching for more specific attributes of the subject can provide the precise information needed to answer the question accurately.\n  iteration: 8\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Byzantine\n    ground_truth:\n      -  Heraclius\n      - Byzantine\n      - Byzantine Empire\n      - Eastern Roman Empire\n      - Roman Empire\n      - Byzantium\n      - Romania\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: True\n    subem_match: True\n  source_entry_labels:\n    - iter1_sol7\n  operator_name: reflection_refine\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\nRules:\n1. The answer in the previous attempt is WRONG — NEVER give that same answer again.\n2. The information that led to that wrong answer may also be wrong — do NOT trust it.\n3. Use DIFFERENT search queries than what was tried before. Search for each entity separately.\n4. Carefully check dates, names, and facts in the search results before concluding.\n5.
