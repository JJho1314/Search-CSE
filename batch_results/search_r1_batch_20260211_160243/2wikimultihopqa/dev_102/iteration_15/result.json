I know that Philip Of Ibelin's mother was Isabella of Tripoli, and she was the daughter of Raymond III of Tripoli and Agnes of Montferrat. Agnes of Montferrat was a daughter of Amalric I of Jerusalem and Maria Komnene, a Byzantine princess. This historical context suggests a strong connection to the Byzantine Empire.
