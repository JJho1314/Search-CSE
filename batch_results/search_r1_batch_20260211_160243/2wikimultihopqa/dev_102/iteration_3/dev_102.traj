You can search as many times as you want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: What nationality is Philip Of Ibelin (1180–1227)'s mother?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  A machine learning approach can be employed if a labeled dataset is available. A supervised learning model, such as a neural network, can be trained to recognize and extract the nationality of a historical figure's mother from text. The model would be trained on a dataset of historical texts where the mother's nationality is explicitly stated. The key data structure is a training dataset and a neural network model, and the expected time complexity for training is O(t * d * n) where t is the number of training iterations, d is the dimensionality of the input data, and n is the number of records, and the space complexity is O(d * n) for storing the model and input data.\n",
