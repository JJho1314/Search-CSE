      "content": "Answer the given question. You must conduct reasoning inside <think> and </think> first every time you get new information. After reasoning, if you find you lack some knowledge, you can call a search engine by <search> query </search> and it will return the top searched results between <information> and </information>. You can search as many times as you want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: What nationality is Philip Of Ibelin (1180–1227)'s mother?\n\nIMPORTANT: Your previous attempt gave a WRONG answer. The previous attempt is shown below.\nYou MUST NOT repeat the same wrong answer. The answer shown below is INCORRECT.\nTry completely different search queries and reasoning to find the correct answer.\n\n### SOURCE TRAJECTORY SUMMARY\n  iter2_sol10\n  label: iter2_sol10\n  solution:\n  ```\n  <think>Both attempts have consistently identified Isabella of Tripoli as Philip Of Ibelin's mother and correctly noted that she was a Byzantine noblewoman. Therefore, the nationality should be Byzantine. However, let's double-check this by searching for more specific information about Isabella of Tripoli and her family background.</think>\n  <search>family background of Isabella of Tripoli</search>\n  <information>\n  <answer>Isabella of Tripoli was the daughter of Leo I of Tripoli and Theodora of Antioch, both of whom were Byzantine nobles.</answer>\n  </information>\n  <think>This confirms that Isabella of Tripoli's mother, Theodora of Antioch, was also a Byzantine noblewoman. Therefore, Isabella of Tripoli herself was Byzantine.</think>\n  <answer>Byzantine</answer>\n  ```\n  metric: 1.0\n  summary:\n    solution_name: multi_hop_v2\n    approach_summary: The agent adopted a multi-hop reasoning approach to verify the nationality of Philip Of Ibelin's mother, Isabella of Tripoli. After identifying Isabella as a Byzantine noblewoman from previous attempts, the agent conducted a search to confirm her family background, which further validated her Byzantine nationality. This approach ensured the accuracy of the answer by providing additional context and verification.\n    search_queries:\n      - family background of Isabella of Tripoli\n    reasoning_quality: Logical and refined. The agent correctly identified the need to verify Isabella of Tripoli's nationality and conducted a specific search to confirm it. The reasoning chain considered the historical context and the specific term used in the ground truth.\n    answer_quality: The final answer 'Byzantine' directly addresses the question and matches the ground truth.\n    key_learnings:\n      - Careful consideration of historical context and precise terminology is crucial for answering questions about historical figures.\n      - Multi-hop reasoning is effective but requires validation steps to ensure the specificity of the answer aligns with the question.\n      - Directly searching for more specific attributes of the subject can provide the precise information needed to answer the question accurately.\n  iteration: 25\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Byzantine\n    ground_truth:\n      -  Heraclius\n      - Byzantine\n      - Byzantine Empire\n      - Eastern Roman Empire\n      - Roman Empire\n      - Byzantium\n      - Romania\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: True\n    subem_match: True\n  source_entry_labels:\n    - iter2_sol1\n    - iter1_sol7\n  operator_name: crossover\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\nRules:\n1. The answer in the previous attempt is WRONG — NEVER give that same answer again.\n2. The information that led to that wrong answer may also be wrong — do NOT trust it.\n3. Use DIFFERENT search queries than what was tried before. Search for each entity separately.\n4. Carefully check dates, names, and facts in the search results before concluding.\n5.
