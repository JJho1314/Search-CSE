Isabella of Tripoli was the wife of Humphrey IV of Tripoli, and her mother was the Byzantine princess Theodora Acciajuoli. This suggests that Isabella of Tripoli had Byzantine ancestry, but her nationality might not necessarily be Byzantine.</think>\n<search>nationality of Isabella of Tripoli based on her mother</search>\n<information>\n<answer>\nIsabella of Tripoli was of Byzantine descent through her mother, Theodora Acciajuoli, but her own nationality is more accurately described as Crusader noble, given the context of her life in the Crusader states in the 12th century.\n</answer>\n</information>\n<think>Based on the new information, the term \"Byzantine\" does not fully capture Isabella of Tripoli's nationality.
