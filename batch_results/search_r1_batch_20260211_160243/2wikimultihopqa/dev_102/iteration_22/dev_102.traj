It started by searching for basic information about Philip Of Ibelin and his mother, which led to the identification of Isabella of Tripoli. Subsequently, the agent searched for Isabella of Tripoli's nationality and confirmed that she was Byzantine. This approach was effective in addressing the question directly through a sequence of targeted searches.\n    search_queries:\n      - who was Philip Of Ibelin and who was his mother\n      - who was Isabella of Tripoli\n      - nationality of Isabella of Tripoli\n    reasoning_quality: Logical and methodical. The agent effectively reasoned through the process of identifying the mother and then determining her nationality without missing crucial connections or repeating previous incorrect answers.\n    answer_quality: The final answer 'Byzantine' directly addresses the question and matches the ground truth, as evidenced by the provided ground truth labels.\n    key_learnings:\n      - Directly searching for the specific entities mentioned in the question (e.g., Philip Of Ibelin's mother) is an effective strategy for gathering relevant information.\n      - Avoiding repetition of previous incorrect answers and focusing on verifying the nationality of Isabella of Tripoli through a direct search was crucial.\n      - Careful and methodical reasoning is necessary to ensure that the information gathered is relevant and accurately addresses the question.\n  iteration: 12\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Byzantine\n    ground_truth:\n      -  Heraclius\n      - Byzantine\n      - Byzantine Empire\n      - Eastern Roman Empire\n      - Roman Empire\n      - Byzantium\n      - Romania\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: True\n    subem_match: True\n  source_entry_labels:\n    - iter1_sol10\n  operator_name: reflection_refine\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\nRules:\n1.
