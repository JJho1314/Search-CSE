By starting from Philip Of Ibelin and traversing the graph, the algorithm can find his mother and extract her nationality. The core logic is a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) to traverse the graph. The key data structure is a graph representation, and the expected time complexity is O(V + E) where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges, and the space complexity is O(V) for the recursion stack or BFS queue.\n",
