After reasoning, if you find you lack some knowledge, you can call a search engine by <search> query </search> and it will return the top searched results between <information> and </information>. You can search as many times as you want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: What nationality is Philip Of Ibelin (1180\u20131227)'s mother?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  A brute-force approach can be used to search through a database or text corpus containing historical records. This involves sequentially checking each record for relevant information. The core logic is to parse the text and look for specific keywords such as 'mother', 'Philip Of Ibelin', and 'nationality'. The key data structure is a simple text index, and the expected time complexity is O(n) where n is the total number of characters in the records, and the space complexity is O(1) since only a few variables are used for storage.\n"
