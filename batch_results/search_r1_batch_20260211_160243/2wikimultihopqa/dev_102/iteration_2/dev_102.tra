After reasoning, if you find you lack some knowledge, you can call a search engine by <search> query </search> and it will return the top searched results between <information> and </information>.

For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: What nationality is Philip Of Ibelin (1180\u20131227)'s mother?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  A pattern matching approach can utilize regular expressions to efficiently find the required information within a text corpus. By constructing a regex pattern that matches the mother's nationality in the context of Philip Of Ibelin, the algorithm can quickly locate the relevant information. The key data structure is a regex engine, and the expected time complexity is O(n) where n is the length of the text to search, and the space complexity is O(1) for the regex pattern.\n"
