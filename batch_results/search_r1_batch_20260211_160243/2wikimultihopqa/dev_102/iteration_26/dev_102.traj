It started by searching for more precise information about her nationality, which led to confirming her status as a Byzantine noblewoman.\n    search_queries:\n      - nationality of Isabella of Tripoli\n    reasoning_quality: Logical and refined. The agent correctly identified the need for verification and conducted a detailed search to confirm Isabella of Tripoli's nationality as Byzantine.\n    answer_quality: The final answer 'Byzantine' directly addresses the question and matches the ground truth.\n    key_learnings:\n      - Careful consideration of historical context and precise terminology is crucial for answering questions about historical figures.\n      - Multi-hop reasoning is effective but requires validation steps to ensure the specificity of the answer aligns with the question.\n      - Directly searching for more specific attributes of the subject can provide the precise information needed to answer the question accurately.\n  iteration: 21\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Byzantine\n    ground_truth:\n      -  Heraclius\n      - Byzantine\n      - Byzantine Empire\n      - Eastern Roman Empire\n      - Roman Empire\n      - Byzantium\n      - Romania\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: True\n    subem_match: True\n  source_entry_labels:\n    - iter1_sol11\n    - iter1_sol6\n  operator_name: crossover\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\nRules:\n1. The answer in the previous attempt is WRONG — NEVER give that same answer again.\n2. The information that led to that wrong answer may also be wrong — do NOT trust it.\n3.
