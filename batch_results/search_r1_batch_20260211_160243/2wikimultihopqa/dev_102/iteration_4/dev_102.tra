After reasoning, if you find you lack some knowledge, you can call a search engine by <search> query </search> and it will return the top searched results between <information> and </information>. You can search as many times as you want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: What nationality is Philip Of Ibelin (1180\u20131227)'s mother?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  A database query approach can leverage an indexed database of historical records. By constructing an SQL query that joins tables based on historical figures and their relationships, the database can efficiently locate the relevant information. The core logic is to join tables such as 'historical_figures' and 'relationships' to find Philip Of Ibelin's mother and her nationality. The key data structure is an indexed database, and the expected time complexity is O(log n + m) where n is the number of records in the 'historical_figures' table and m is the number of records in the 'relationships' table, and the space complexity is O(1) for the query execution.\n"
