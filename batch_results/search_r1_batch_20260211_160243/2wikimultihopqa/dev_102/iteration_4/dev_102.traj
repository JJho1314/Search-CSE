By constructing an SQL query that joins tables based on historical figures and their relationships, the database can efficiently locate the relevant information. The core logic is to join tables such as 'historical_figures' and 'relationships' to find Philip Of Ibelin's mother and her nationality. The key data structure is an indexed database, and the expected time complexity is O(log n + m) where n is the number of records in the 'historical_figures' table and m is the number of records in the 'relationships' table, and the space complexity is O(1) for the query execution.\n",
