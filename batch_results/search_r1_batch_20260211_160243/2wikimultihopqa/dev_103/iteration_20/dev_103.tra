Despite the search not yielding results for Joseph J. Magliocco initially, the agent persisted and eventually found the correct information.\n    search_queries:\n      - <search>Joseph J. Magliocco birth date</search>\n      - <search>Viktoriya Zeynep G\u00fcne\u015f birth date</search>\n    reasoning_quality: Logical and clear. The agent effectively used the search results and properly reasoned through the comparison of birth dates.\n    answer_quality: The final answer directly addresses the question and is correct.\n    key_learnings:\n      - Persistence is key in cases where initial searches do not yield results.\n      - Ensure that names are spelled correctly in the search queries.\n      - Direct search for specific factual information is effective, especially when the information is straightforward.\n  iteration: 9\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Viktoriya Zeynep G\u00fcne\u015f\n    ground_truth:\n      - Viktoria Solnceva\n      - Viktoriya Zeynep G\u00fcne\u015f\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: True\n    subem_match: True\n  source_entry_labels:\n    - iter1_sol5\n    - iter1_sol1\n  operator_name: crossover\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\nRules:\n1. The answer in the previous attempt is WRONG \u2014 NEVER give that same answer again.\n2. The information that led to that wrong answer may also be wrong \u2014 do NOT trust it.\n3. Use DIFFERENT search queries than what was tried before. Search for each entity separately.\n4. Carefully check dates, names, and facts in the search results before concluding.\n5.
