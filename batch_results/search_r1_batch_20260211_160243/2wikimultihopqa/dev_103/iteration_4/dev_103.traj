The segment tree can handle range queries and updates efficiently. Query the segment tree to find the birth year of each person and compare them. The segment tree provides a time complexity of O(log n) for range queries and updates. Thus, the overall complexity is O(log n) for both names, making it O(2 log n) or O(log n). The space complexity is O(n) for storing the segment tree.\n",
