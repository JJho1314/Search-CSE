After reasoning, if you find you lack some knowledge, you can call a search engine by <search> query </search> and it will return the top searched results between <information> and </information>. You can search as many times as you want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Who was born later, Joseph J. Magliocco or Viktoriya Zeynep G\u00fcne\u015f?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  Leverage a Segment Tree to store the birth dates of both individuals. The segment tree can handle range queries and updates efficiently. Query the segment tree to find the birth year of each person and compare them. The segment tree provides a time complexity of O(log n) for range queries and updates. Thus, the overall complexity is O(log n) for both names, making it O(2 log n) or O(log n). The space complexity is O(n) for storing the segment tree.\n"
