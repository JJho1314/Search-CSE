You can search as many times as you want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Who was born later, Joseph J. Magliocco or Viktoriya Zeynep Güneş?\n\nIMPORTANT: Your previous attempt gave a WRONG answer.

Magliocco or Viktoriya Zeynep Güneş. I need to find their birth years to determine this.\n\n  From the previous attempts, I know:\n  - Joseph J. Magliocco was born in 1954\n  - Viktoriya Zeynep Güneş was born in 1988\n\n  Since both attempts gave me the same birth years, I should verify these dates again and ensure that I have the correct individuals.\n  </think>\n  <search>Joseph J.

Magliocco and Viktoriya Zeynep Güneş. The agent first reasoned about the question and then searched for each individual's birth year separately. After confirming the birth years from the search results, the agent provided the correct answer.\n    search_queries:\n      - Joseph J. Magliocco birth year\n      - Viktoriya Zeynep Güneş birth year\n    reasoning_quality: Logical and consistent. The agent effectively used the search results to confirm the birth years and made the correct comparison.\n    answer_quality: Correct. The final answer matches the ground truth, as Viktoriya Zeynep Güneş was born later than Joseph J. Magliocco.\n    key_learnings:\n      - Direct search can be effective for questions involving specific individuals and their attributes.\n      - Using reliable sources like Wikipedia can provide accurate and relevant information.\n      - Double-checking information from multiple sources can help ensure accuracy, especially when previous solutions were incorrect.\n  iteration: 25\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Viktoriya Zeynep Güneş\n    ground_truth:\n      - Viktoria Solnceva\n      - Viktoriya Zeynep Güneş\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: True\n    subem_match: True\n  source_entry_labels:\n    - iter1_sol14\n    - iter1_sol8\n  operator_name: crossover\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\nRules:\n1. The answer in the previous attempt is WRONG — NEVER give that same answer again.\n2. The information that led to that wrong answer may also be wrong — do NOT trust it.\n3. Use DIFFERENT search queries than what was tried before. Search for each entity separately.\n4. Carefully check dates, names, and facts in the search results before concluding.\n5.
