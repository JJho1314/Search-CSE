After initially searching and finding the birth year of Viktoriya Zeynep G\u00fcne\u015f, the agent then searched for Joseph J. Magliocco's birth year to compare. Despite the correct information being found, the agent provided the answer in a manner that did not address the specific question asked, leading to a binary metric of 0.0.\n    search_queries:\n      - Joseph J. Magliocco birth year\n    reasoning_quality: The reasoning chain was logical and straightforward. The agent correctly identified the need to compare birth years and used the search results to make the comparison. However, the answer was not provided in the correct format, which resulted in an incorrect answer.\n    answer_quality: Incorrect. The final answer 'Viktoriya Zeynep G\u00fcne\u015f' was provided without clearly addressing the question, which was specifically asking to identify the person who was born later.\n    key_learnings:\n      - It is crucial to ensure that the final answer directly and clearly addresses the question being asked.\n      - The agent should double-check the formatting of the answer to ensure it matches the required format (e.g., <answer> tag).\n      - Even with correct information, the agent must present the answer in a way that clearly indicates the final conclusion.\n  iteration: 6\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Viktoriya Zeynep G\u00fcne\u015f\n    ground_truth:\n      - Viktoria Solnceva\n      - Viktoriya Zeynep G\u00fcne\u015f\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: True\n    subem_match: True\n  source_entry_labels:\n    - iter1_sol2\n  operator_name: reflection_refine\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\nRules:\n1. The answer in the previous attempt is WRONG \u2014 NEVER give that same answer again.\n2. The information that led to that wrong answer may also be wrong \u2014 do NOT trust it.\n3. Use DIFFERENT search queries than what was tried before. Search for each entity separately.\n4. Carefully check dates, names, and facts in the search results before concluding.\n5. Put your final answer inside <answer>...</answer> tags.\n"
