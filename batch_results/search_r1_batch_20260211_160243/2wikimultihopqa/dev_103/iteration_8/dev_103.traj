Instead, the agent directly searched for the birth dates of Joseph J. Magliocco and Viktoriya Zeynep Güneş. After obtaining the dates, the agent compared them and provided the correct answer.\n    search_queries:\n      - <search>Joseph J. Magliocco birth date</search>\n      - <search>Viktoriya Zeynep Güneş birth date</search>\n    reasoning_quality: Logical. The agent efficiently searched for the required information and correctly reasoned about the birth dates to determine the answer.\n    answer_quality: Correct. The final answer matches the ground truth.\n    key_learnings:\n      - For this type of question, searching directly for the required information (birth dates) is more straightforward and efficient than using a complex data structure.\n      - Ensure the names used in the search match exactly with the names provided in the question.\n  iteration: 1\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Viktoriya Zeynep Güneş\n    ground_truth:\n      - Viktoria Solnceva\n      - Viktoriya Zeynep Güneş\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: True\n    subem_match: True\n  source_entry_labels:\n\n  operator_name: plan\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\nRules:\n1. The answer in the previous attempt is WRONG — NEVER give that same answer again.\n2. The information that led to that wrong answer may also be wrong — do NOT trust it.\n3. Use DIFFERENT search queries than what was tried before. Search for each entity separately.\n4. Carefully check dates, names, and facts in the search results before concluding.\n5.
