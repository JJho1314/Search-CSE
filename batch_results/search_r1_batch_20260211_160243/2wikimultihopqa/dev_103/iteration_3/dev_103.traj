Magliocco or Viktoriya Zeynep Güneş?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  Utilize a Hash Map to store the birth dates of both individuals. The keys are the names and the values are their respective birth years. Retrieve the birth years for both individuals and compare them. Hash Map insertions and lookups have an average time complexity of O(1). Therefore, the total time complexity is O(1) for both names, resulting in an overall complexity of O(2) or O(1). The space complexity is O(1) for storing the hash map.\n",
