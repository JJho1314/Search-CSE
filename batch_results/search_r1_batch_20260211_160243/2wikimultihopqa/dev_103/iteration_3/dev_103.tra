You can search as many times as you want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Who was born later, Joseph J. Magliocco or Viktoriya Zeynep G\u00fcne\u015f?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  Utilize a Hash Map to store the birth dates of both individuals. The keys are the names and the values are their respective birth years. Retrieve the birth years for both individuals and compare them. Hash Map insertions and lookups have an average time complexity of O(1). Therefore, the total time complexity is O(1) for both names, resulting in an overall complexity of O(2) or O(1). The space complexity is O(1) for storing the hash map.\n"
