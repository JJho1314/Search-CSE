Magliocco or Viktoriya Zeynep G\u00fcne\u015f?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  Apply a simple comparison of the birth years directly without any data structures. Parse the birth years from the given names and compare them directly. This approach has a time complexity of O(1) as it involves basic string parsing and comparison operations. The space complexity is O(1) as no additional data structures are needed.\n"
