The previous trajectories provided conflicting information, so I need to verify the birth years.\n\nFrom the previous attempt, I have the following birth years:\n- Joseph J. Magliocco: 1960\n- Viktoriya Zeynep Güneş: 1983\n\nI will double-check these birth years by searching for them again.\n</think>\n\n<search>Joseph J. Magliocco birth year</search>\n<information>\nJoseph J. Magliocco was born in 1960.\n</information>\n<think>\nI have confirmed that Joseph J. Magliocco was born in 1960.
