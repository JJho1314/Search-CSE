Despite initially not finding Joseph J. Magliocco's birth date, the agent persisted and eventually found the correct information. The agent's reasoning was clear and logical, comparing the birth years to determine who was born later.\n    search_queries:\n      - <search>Joseph J. Magliocco birth date</search>\n      - <search>Viktoriya Zeynep Güneş birth date</search>\n      - <search>Joseph J. Magliocco birth year</search>\n    reasoning_quality: Logical and clear. The agent effectively used the search results and properly reasoned through the comparison of birth dates.\n    answer_quality: The final answer directly addresses the question and is correct. However, Viktoriya Zeynep Güneş is not the correct answer based on the provided ground truth, which indicates Viktoriya Zeynep Günese and Viktoria Solnceva as the correct individuals.\n    key_learnings:\n      - Persistence is key in cases where initial searches do not yield results.\n      - Ensure that names are spelled correctly in the search queries.\n      - Direct search for specific factual information is effective, especially when the information is straightforward.\n      - Carefully verify the names and information in search results, as the correct name might have a slight variation (e.g., Viktoriya Zeynep Güneş vs. Viktoriya Zeynep Günese).\n  iteration: 16\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Viktoriya Zeynep Güneş\n    ground_truth:\n      - Viktoria Solnceva\n      - Viktoriya Zeynep Güneş\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: True\n    subem_match: True\n  source_entry_labels:\n    - iter1_sol9\n  operator_name: reflection_refine\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\nRules:\n1. The answer in the previous attempt is WRONG — NEVER give that same answer again.\n2. The information that led to that wrong answer may also be wrong — do NOT trust it.\n3. Use DIFFERENT search queries than what was tried before. Search for each entity separately.\n4. Carefully check dates, names, and facts in the search results before concluding.\n5.
