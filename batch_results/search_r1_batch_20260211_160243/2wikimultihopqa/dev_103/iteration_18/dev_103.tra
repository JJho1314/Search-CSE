After reasoning, if you find you lack some knowledge, you can call a search engine by <search> query </search> and it will return the top searched results between <information> and </information>. You can search as many times as you want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Who was born later, Joseph J. Magliocco or Viktoriya Zeynep G\u00fcne\u015f?\n\nIMPORTANT: Your previous attempt gave a WRONG answer. The previous attempt is shown below.\nYou MUST NOT repeat the same wrong answer.

They reasoned step-by-step to compare the years and determine which person was born later. This method is effective for factual questions that require direct comparison of specific information.\n    search_queries:\n      - Joseph J. Magliocco birth year\n      - Viktoriya Zeynep G\u00fcne\u015f birth year\n    reasoning_quality: Logical and clear. The agent correctly identified the need to search for birth years and then logically compared the years to determine the final answer.\n    answer_quality: The final answer directly addresses the question and is correct.\n    key_learnings:\n      - Direct search for specific factual information is effective.\n      - Step-by-step reasoning and comparison are crucial for correct answers.\n      - Ensure that the information found is relevant to the question (e.g., checking for correct name spellings).\n  iteration: 5\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Viktoriya Zeynep G\u00fcne\u015f\n    ground_truth:\n      - Viktoria Solnceva\n      - Viktoriya Zeynep G\u00fcne\u015f\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: True\n    subem_match: True\n  source_entry_labels:\n\n  operator_name: plan\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\nRules:\n1. The answer in the previous attempt is WRONG \u2014 NEVER give that same answer again.\n2. The information that led to that wrong answer may also be wrong \u2014 do NOT trust it.\n3. Use DIFFERENT search queries than what was tried before. Search for each entity separately.\n4. Carefully check dates, names, and facts in the search results before concluding.\n5.
