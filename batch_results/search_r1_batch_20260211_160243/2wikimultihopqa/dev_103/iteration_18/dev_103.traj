They reasoned step-by-step to compare the years and determine which person was born later. This method is effective for factual questions that require direct comparison of specific information.\n    search_queries:\n      - Joseph J. Magliocco birth year\n      - Viktoriya Zeynep Güneş birth year\n    reasoning_quality: Logical and clear. The agent correctly identified the need to search for birth years and then logically compared the years to determine the final answer.\n    answer_quality: The final answer directly addresses the question and is correct.\n    key_learnings:\n      - Direct search for specific factual information is effective.\n      - Step-by-step reasoning and comparison are crucial for correct answers.\n      - Ensure that the information found is relevant to the question (e.g., checking for correct name spellings).\n  iteration: 5\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Viktoriya Zeynep Güneş\n    ground_truth:\n      - Viktoria Solnceva\n      - Viktoriya Zeynep Güneş\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: True\n    subem_match: True\n  source_entry_labels:\n\n  operator_name: plan\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\nRules:\n1. The answer in the previous attempt is WRONG — NEVER give that same answer again.\n2. The information that led to that wrong answer may also be wrong — do NOT trust it.\n3. Use DIFFERENT search queries than what was tried before. Search for each entity separately.\n4. Carefully check dates, names, and facts in the search results before concluding.\n5.
