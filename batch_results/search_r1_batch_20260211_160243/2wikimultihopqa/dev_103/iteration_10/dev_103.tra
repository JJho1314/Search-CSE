Instead, the agent directly searched for the birth dates of Joseph J. Magliocco and Viktoriya Zeynep G\u00fcne\u015f. After obtaining the dates, the agent compared them and provided the correct answer.\n    search_queries:\n      - <search>Joseph J. Magliocco birth date</search>\n      - <search>Viktoriya Zeynep G\u00fcne\u015f birth date</search>\n    reasoning_quality: Logical. The agent efficiently searched for the required information and correctly reasoned about the birth dates to determine the answer.\n    answer_quality: Correct. The final answer matches the ground truth.\n    key_learnings:\n      - For this type of question, searching directly for the required information (birth dates) is more straightforward and efficient than using a complex data structure.\n      - Ensure the names used in the search match exactly with the names provided in the question.\n  iteration: 1\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Viktoriya Zeynep G\u00fcne\u015f\n    ground_truth:\n      - Viktoria Solnceva\n      - Viktoriya Zeynep G\u00fcne\u015f\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: True\n    subem_match: True\n  source_entry_labels:\n\n  operator_name: plan\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\nRules:\n1. The answer in the previous attempt is WRONG \u2014 NEVER give that same answer again.\n2. The information that led to that wrong answer may also be wrong \u2014 do NOT trust it.\n3. Use DIFFERENT search queries than what was tried before. Search for each entity separately.\n4. Carefully check dates, names, and facts in the search results before concluding.\n5.
