Magliocco or Viktoriya Zeynep Güneş?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  Employ a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) to store the birth dates of both individuals. Use the names as keys and their corresponding birth years as values. Query the BIT to find the birth year of each person and compare them. The BIT allows for efficient updates and range queries, providing a time complexity of O(log n) for each operation. Thus, the overall complexity is O(log n) for both names, making it O(2 log n) or O(log n). The space complexity is O(n) for storing the BIT.\n",
