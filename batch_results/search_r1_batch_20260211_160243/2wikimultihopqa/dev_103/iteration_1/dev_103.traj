After reasoning, if you find you lack some knowledge, you can call a search engine by <search> query </search> and it will return the top searched results between <information> and </information>. You can search as many times as you want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Who was born later, Joseph J. Magliocco or Viktoriya Zeynep Güneş?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  Use a Trie data structure to store the birth dates of Joseph J. Magliocco and Viktoriya Zeynep Güneş in lexicographical order. For each name, perform a binary search to find the exact position where the birth date would be inserted. Compare the birth dates to determine who was born later. The Trie has a time complexity of O(n) for insertion and O(log n) for binary search, resulting in a total complexity of O(n log n) for both names. The space complexity is O(n) for storing the names and dates in the Trie.\n",
