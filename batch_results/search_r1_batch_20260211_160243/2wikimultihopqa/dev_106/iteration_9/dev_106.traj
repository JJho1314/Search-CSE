Upon realizing the error, the agent corrected its approach by searching for the countries of origin for both movies. It used two separate search queries to gather the necessary information and then reasoned that since one movie is from France and the other from the United States, they are from different countries.\n    search_queries:\n      - <search>country of origin for About A Wife, A Dream And Another...</search>\n      - <search>country of origin for The Doolins of Oklahoma</search>\n    reasoning_quality: Logical and coherent.

Despite multiple searches yielding no relevant information, the agent concluded that the movies could be from different countries and provided an answer of 'no' based on this assumption.\n    search_queries:\n      - <search>About A Wife, A Dream And Another...</search>\n      - <search>The Doolins Of Oklahoma</search>\n      - <search>origin of About A Wife, A Dream And Another...</search>\n      - <search>origin of The Doolins Of Oklahoma</search>\n    reasoning_quality: The reasoning chain was logical but ineffective, as the agent assumed the movies were from different countries based on the lack of specific information, rather than deducing the correct answer through more sophisticated means or logical connections.\n    answer_quality: The final answer of 'no' correctly matches the ground truth, but the reasoning process was not optimal as it relied on a default assumption without further investigation into the possibility of a common origin.\n    key_learnings:\n      - When searching for information that is not readily available, consider alternative ways to infer the answer rather than defaulting to a general assumption.\n      - Expanding the search to include broader context or related information could provide clues that are not immediately apparent from the titles alone.\n      - Improving the search strategy to address the limitations of the initial search queries could lead to more accurate and efficient information retrieval.\n  iteration: 5\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: no\n    ground_truth:\n      - no\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: True\n    subem_match: True\n  source_entry_labels:\n\n  operator_name: plan\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\nRules:\n1.
