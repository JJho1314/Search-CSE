When no direct information was found, it concluded that the movies were from different countries based on the origins of each movie.\n    search_queries:\n      - <search>country of origin for About A Wife, A Dream And Another...</search>\n      - <search>country of origin for The Doolins of Oklahoma</search>\n      - <search>connection between About A Wife, A Dream And Another... and The Doolins of Oklahoma</search>\n    reasoning_quality: The reasoning was logical and thorough.

Despite multiple searches yielding no relevant information, the agent concluded that the movies could be from different countries and provided an answer of 'no' based on this assumption.\n    search_queries:\n      - <search>About A Wife, A Dream And Another...</search>\n      - <search>The Doolins Of Oklahoma</search>\n      - <search>origin of About A Wife, A Dream And Another...</search>\n      - <search>origin of The Doolins Of Oklahoma</search>\n    reasoning_quality: The reasoning chain was logical but ineffective, as the agent assumed the movies were from different countries based on the lack of specific information, rather than deducing the correct answer through more sophisticated means or logical connections.\n    answer_quality: The final answer of 'no' correctly matches the ground truth, but the reasoning process was not optimal as it relied on a default assumption without further investigation into the possibility of a common origin.\n    key_learnings:\n      - When searching for information that is not readily available, consider alternative ways to infer the answer rather than defaulting to a general assumption.\n      - Expanding the search to include broader context or related information could provide clues that are not immediately apparent from the titles alone.\n      - Improving the search strategy to address the limitations of the initial search queries could lead to more accurate and efficient information retrieval.\n  iteration: 5\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: no\n    ground_truth:\n      - no\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: True\n    subem_match: True\n  source_entry_labels:\n\n  operator_name: plan\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\nRules:\n1. Both answers below are WRONG \u2014 NEVER give either of them as your answer.\n2. The information that led to those wrong answers may be incorrect \u2014 verify everything.\n3.
