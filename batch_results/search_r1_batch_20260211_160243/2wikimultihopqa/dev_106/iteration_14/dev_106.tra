However, the lack of information does not necessarily mean the movies are from the same country. Let's assume they are from different countries and search for their origins.\n  </think>\n  <search>origin of About A Wife, A Dream And Another...</search>\n  <information>\n  [No relevant information found]\n  </information>\n  <search>origin of The Doolins Of Oklahoma</search>\n  <information>\n  [No relevant information found]\n  </information>\n  <think>\n  Since I still couldn't find specific information about these movies, I will consider the possibility that these are independent productions. Let's assume that there's no common origin and each movie was produced in a different country.\n  </think>\n  <answer>no</answer>\n  ```\n  metric: 1.0\n  summary:\n    solution_name: multi_hop_v2\n    approach_summary: The agent attempted to find information about the origin countries of two movies, 'About A Wife, A Dream And Another...' and 'The Doolins Of Oklahoma', by individually searching for each title and then searching for their origins. Despite multiple searches yielding no relevant information, the agent concluded that the movies could be from different countries and provided an answer of 'no' based on this assumption.\n    search_queries:\n      - <search>About A Wife, A Dream And Another...</search>\n      - <search>The Doolins Of Oklahoma</search>\n      - <search>origin of About A Wife, A Dream And Another...</search>\n      - <search>origin of The Doolins Of Oklahoma</search>\n    reasoning_quality: The reasoning chain was logical but ineffective, as the agent assumed the movies were from different countries based on the lack of specific information, rather than deducing the correct answer through more sophisticated means or logical connections.\n    answer_quality: The final answer of 'no' correctly matches the ground truth, but the reasoning process was not optimal as it relied on a default assumption without further investigation into the possibility of a common origin.\n    key_learnings:\n      - When searching for information that is not readily available, consider alternative ways to infer the answer rather than defaulting to a general assumption.\n      - Expanding the search to include broader context or related information could provide clues that are not immediately apparent from the titles alone.\n      - Improving the search strategy to address the limitations of the initial search queries could lead to more accurate and efficient information retrieval.\n  iteration: 5\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: no\n    ground_truth:\n      - no\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: True\n    subem_match: True\n  source_entry_labels:\n\n  operator_name: plan\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\nRules:\n1. The answer in the previous attempt is WRONG \u2014 NEVER give that same answer again.\n2. The information that led to that wrong answer may also be wrong \u2014 do NOT trust it.\n3. Use DIFFERENT search queries than what was tried before. Search for each entity separately.\n4. Carefully check dates, names, and facts in the search results before concluding.\n5. Put your final answer inside <answer>...</answer> tags.\n"
