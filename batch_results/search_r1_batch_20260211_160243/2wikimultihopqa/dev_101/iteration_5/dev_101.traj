After reasoning, if you find you lack some knowledge, you can call a search engine by <search> query </search> and it will return the top searched results between <information> and </information>. You can search as many times as you want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: What is the place of birth of the performer of song Heaven (Namie Amuro Song)?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  A string matching strategy utilizes the song title 'Heaven' and searches for it in a database of song titles. Once the song is found, it extracts the performer's information, including the place of birth, from a related field. This approach leverages efficient string search algorithms like Trie or Aho-Corasick. The time complexity for the search is O(m + n) where m is the length of the pattern ('Heaven') and n is the length of the text (database entries), and the space complexity is O(1) for the search itself, but O(n) for storing the database.\n",
