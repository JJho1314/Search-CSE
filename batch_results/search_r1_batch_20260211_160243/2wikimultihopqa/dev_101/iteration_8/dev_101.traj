After reasoning, if you find you lack some knowledge, you can call a search engine by <search> query </search> and it will return the top searched results between <information> and </information>. You can search as many times as you want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: What is the place of birth of the performer of song Heaven (Namie Amuro Song)?\n\nIMPORTANT: Your previous attempt gave a WRONG answer. The previous attempt is shown below.\nYou MUST NOT repeat the same wrong answer. The answer shown below is INCORRECT.\nTry completely different search queries and reasoning to find the correct answer.\n\n### SOURCE TRAJECTORY SUMMARY\n  iter1_sol2\n  label: iter1_sol2\n  solution:\n  ```\n  <think>My previous answer was incorrect. I need to search for the place of birth of Namie Amuro, the performer of the song \"Heaven\".</think>\n  <search>Namie Amuro place of birth</search>\n  <information>\n  NAMIE AMURO BIRTHPLACE: Japan\n  </information>\n  <think>The information clearly states that Namie Amuro's place of birth is Japan. Namie Amuro is a well-known Japanese singer, so this makes sense.</think>\n  <answer>Japan</answer>\n  ```\n  metric: 0.0\n  summary:\n    solution_name: direct_search\n    approach_summary: The agent initially tried to solve the problem using a hybrid approach with a pre-built index of performer names, but it was incorrect. The agent then corrected its strategy by searching directly for the place of birth of Namie Amuro, the performer of the song 'Heaven'. Despite the search result stating that Namie Amuro's place of birth is Japan, the agent did not specify the city, which is not the exact match to the ground truth.\n    search_queries:\n      - <search>Namie Amuro place of birth</search>\n    reasoning_quality: Logical but missed specifying the city within the country, which was not the exact match to the ground truth.\n    answer_quality: The final answer 'Japan' is close but not exact as the ground truth includes a more specific location 'Naha, Okinawa'.\n    key_learnings:\n      - It's important to provide a more specific location when possible, even if a general answer seems correct.\n      - The agent could have further refined its search to include more context about the performer's origin if the initial search did not provide a detailed answer.\n  iteration: 2\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Japan\n    ground_truth:\n      - Naha\n      - Naha, Japan\n      - Naha, Okinawa\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: False\n    subem_match: False\n    failure_reason: Answer 'Japan' does not match any of ['Naha', 'Naha, Japan', 'Naha, Okinawa']\n  source_entry_labels:\n\n  operator_name: plan\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\nRules:\n1. The answer in the previous attempt is WRONG — NEVER give that same answer again.\n2. The information that led to that wrong answer may also be wrong — do NOT trust it.\n3. Use DIFFERENT search queries than what was tried before. Search for each entity separately.\n4. Carefully check dates, names, and facts in the search results before concluding.\n5. Put your final answer inside <answer>...</answer> tags.\n",
