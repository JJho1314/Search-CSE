For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: What is the place of birth of the performer of song Heaven (Namie Amuro Song)?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  A graph traversal approach involves constructing a graph where nodes represent performers and edges represent collaborations or performances of songs together. Starting from Namie Amuro, we can traverse the graph to find the birthplace information, leveraging techniques like Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS). The time complexity is O(V + E) where V is the number of nodes (performers) and E is the number of edges (collaborations), and the space complexity is O(V) for storing the graph.\n"
