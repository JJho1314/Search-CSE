Starting from Namie Amuro, we can traverse the graph to find the birthplace information, leveraging techniques like Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS). The time complexity is O(V + E) where V is the number of nodes (performers) and E is the number of edges (collaborations), and the space complexity is O(V) for storing the graph.\n",
