The agent refined the search queries to be more precise by using 'performer of Heaven song by Namie Amuro' and 'Namie Amuro place of birth'. The reasoning was logical and direct, but the final answer was not in the exact format expected by the ground truth.\n    search_queries:\n      - <search>performer of Heaven song by Namie Amuro</search>\n      - <search>Namie Amuro place of birth</search>\n    reasoning_quality: Logical reasoning was used to connect the performer of the song to their place of birth. The agent improved by refining the search queries to match the specific information needed. However, the search results were still not in the exact format expected by the ground truth.\n    answer_quality: The answer 'Naha, Okinawa, Japan' directly addresses the question and is correct based on the information found. However, it did not match the expected format exactly, as the ground truth included variations like 'Naha, Japan' or simply 'Naha'.\n    key_learnings:\n      - Ensure the search queries are precise and directly address the question at hand.\n      - Be aware of potential mismatches in the format of the expected answer and the retrieved information.\n      - Consider multi-hop reasoning to cover all possible information sources and formats.\n  iteration: 14\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Naha, Okinawa, Japan\n    ground_truth:\n      - Naha\n      - Naha, Japan\n      - Naha, Okinawa\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: False\n    subem_match: True\n    failure_reason: Answer 'Naha, Okinawa, Japan' does not match any of ['Naha', 'Naha, Japan', 'Naha, Okinawa']\n  source_entry_labels:\n    - iter1_sol1\n  operator_name: reflection_refine\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\n### TRAJECTORY 2 SUMMARY\n  iter1_sol5\n  label: iter1_sol5\n  solution:\n  ```\n  <think>\n  The previous attempt did not yield the correct answer.

When the search was unsuccessful, the agent then assumed that the question was asking about Namie Amuro's place of birth.
