After reasoning, if you find you lack some knowledge, you can call a search engine by <search> query </search> and it will return the top searched results between <information> and </information>. You can search as many times as you want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: What is the place of birth of the performer of song Heaven (Namie Amuro Song)?\n\nIMPORTANT: Two previous attempts are shown below. BOTH gave WRONG answers.\nYou MUST NOT repeat either wrong answer. Both answers shown below are INCORRECT.\nUse any useful search results from both attempts, but reach a DIFFERENT conclusion.\n\n### TRAJECTORY 1 SUMMARY\n  iter1_sol8\n  label: iter1_sol8\n  solution:\n  ```\n  <think>I need to find the specific place of birth of Namie Amuro, the performer of the song \"Heaven\". I should search for a more detailed location than just the country.</think>\n  <search>Namie Amuro place of birth city</search>\n  <information>\n  NAMIE AMURO BIRTHPLACE: Naha, Okinawa, Japan\n  </information>\n  <think>The information clearly states that Namie Amuro was born in Naha, Okinawa, Japan. This provides a more specific location.</think>\n  <answer>Naha, Okinawa, Japan</answer>\n  ```\n  metric: 0.0\n  summary:\n    solution_name: direct_search\n    approach_summary: The agent revised its strategy by searching for the place of birth of Namie Amuro, specifically asking for the city. It used a more targeted search query to obtain a more detailed location, which led to the correct answer.\n    search_queries:\n      - <search>Namie Amuro place of birth city</search>\n    reasoning_quality: Logical and improved from the previous attempt by focusing on specificity.\n    answer_quality: The final answer 'Naha, Okinawa, Japan' correctly matches the ground truth.\n    key_learnings:\n      - It is crucial to refine search queries to obtain more specific information.\n      - Ensuring the answer matches the exact phrasing in the ground truth is important.\n  iteration: 8\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Naha, Okinawa, Japan\n    ground_truth:\n      - Naha\n      - Naha, Japan\n      - Naha, Okinawa\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: False\n    subem_match: True\n    failure_reason: Answer 'Naha, Okinawa, Japan' does not match any of ['Naha', 'Naha, Japan', 'Naha, Okinawa']\n  source_entry_labels:\n    - iter1_sol2\n  operator_name: reflection_refine\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\n### TRAJECTORY 2 SUMMARY\n  iter1_sol5\n  label: iter1_sol5\n  solution:\n  ```\n  <think>\n  The previous attempt did not yield the correct answer. Let's start by searching for the performer of the song 'Heaven'.\n  </think>\n  <search>performer of the song Heaven</search>\n  <information>\n  [None of the results mention Namie Amuro as the performer.]\n  </information>\n  <think>\n  Since the performer was not directly found, let's assume the question requires finding Namie Amuro's place of birth.\n  </think>\n  <search>Namie Amuro place of birth</search>\n  <information>\n  [Namie Amuro was born in Tokyo, Japan.]\n  </information>\n  <answer>\n  Tokyo, Japan\n  </answer>\n  ```\n  metric: 0.0\n  summary:\n    solution_name: multi_hop_v2\n    approach_summary: The agent initially tried to find the performer of the song 'Heaven' by searching for that specific song. When the search was unsuccessful, the agent then assumed that the question was asking about Namie Amuro's place of birth. Although the agent correctly found Namie Amuro's place of birth, the answer did not match the ground truth due to a mismatch in specific location details (Tokyo, Japan vs. Naha, Japan).\n    search_queries:\n      - <search>performer of the song Heaven</search>\n      - <search>Namie Amuro place of birth</search>\n    reasoning_quality: The reasoning was logical but the agent missed connecting the song 'Heaven' to Namie Amuro directly, which led to an incorrect assumption about the question's intent.\n    answer_quality: The final answer addressed the question but did not match the specific location details provided in the ground truth.\n    key_learnings:\n      - It is important to verify that the assumed connection between the question and the search query is accurate.\n      - Exact location matching is crucial when dealing with place of birth information.\n      - Strategically searching for additional context (e.g., the song's album or release information) might provide more direct answers.\n  iteration: 5\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Tokyo, Japan\n    ground_truth:\n      - Naha\n      - Naha, Japan\n      - Naha, Okinawa\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: False\n    subem_match: False\n    failure_reason: Answer 'Tokyo, Japan' does not match any of ['Naha', 'Naha, Japan', 'Naha, Okinawa']\n  source_entry_labels:\n\n  operator_name: plan\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\nRules:\n1. Both answers below are WRONG — NEVER give either of them as your answer.\n2. The information that led to those wrong answers may be incorrect — verify everything.\n3. Look at what useful facts each attempt found, but do NOT trust their conclusions.\n4. Try NEW search queries to find information that both attempts missed.\n5. Carefully check dates, names, and facts before concluding.\n6. Put your final answer inside <answer>...</answer> tags.\n",
