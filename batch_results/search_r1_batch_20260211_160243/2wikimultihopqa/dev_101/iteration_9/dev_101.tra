After reasoning, if you find you lack some knowledge, you can call a search engine by <search> query </search> and it will return the top searched results between <information> and </information>. You can search as many times as you want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: What is the place of birth of the performer of song Heaven (Namie Amuro Song)?\n\nIMPORTANT: Two previous attempts are shown below. BOTH gave WRONG answers.\nYou MUST NOT repeat either wrong answer. Both answers shown below are INCORRECT.\nUse any useful search results from both attempts, but reach a DIFFERENT conclusion.\n\n### TRAJECTORY 1 SUMMARY\n  iter1_sol6\n  label: iter1_sol6\n  solution:\n  ```\n  <think>I need to find the place of birth of Namie Amuro, the performer of the song \"Heaven\". I will search for her place of birth now.</think>\n  <search>Namie Amuro place of birth</search>\n  <information>\n  NAMIE AMURO BIRTHPLACE: Naha, Okinawa, Japan\n  </information>\n  <think>The information clearly states that Namie Amuro was born in Naha, Okinawa, Japan.

Initially, the agent searched for 'Namie Amuro place of birth' and received the information 'NAMIE AMURO BIRTHPLACE: Naha, Okinawa, Japan'. The agent then reasoned that this provided a more specific location and adjusted the answer accordingly.\n    search_queries:\n      - <search>Namie Amuro place of birth</search>\n    reasoning_quality: Logical and effective. The agent correctly identified the need for a more specific location and adjusted its answer accordingly.\n    answer_quality: The final answer 'Naha, Okinawa, Japan' correctly matches the ground truth.\n    key_learnings:\n      - Properly specifying a more detailed location is crucial, even if a general location seems correct.\n      - Direct and focused searches can lead to accurate and specific information.\n      - Reviewing the search results and ensuring the answer aligns with the provided information is important.\n  iteration: 6\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Naha, Okinawa, Japan\n    ground_truth:\n      - Naha\n      - Naha, Japan\n      - Naha, Okinawa\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: False\n    subem_match: True\n    failure_reason: Answer 'Naha, Okinawa, Japan' does not match any of ['Naha', 'Naha, Japan', 'Naha, Okinawa']\n  source_entry_labels:\n    - iter1_sol2\n  operator_name: reflection_refine\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\n### TRAJECTORY 2 SUMMARY\n  iter1_sol4\n  label: iter1_sol4\n  solution:\n  ```\n  The question asks for the place of birth of the performer of the song \"Heaven.\" Since I don't have the performer's name directly, I need to find the performer first. \n\n  <think>\n  1.

After realizing the performer was Namie Amuro from the search results, the agent searched for her birthplace and correctly found that she was born in Sapporo, Hokkaid\u014d, Japan. Despite this correct information, the final answer did not match the ground truth, which included Naha, Japan.\n    search_queries:\n      - <search>performer of the song Heaven (Namie Amuro Song)</search>\n      - <search>Namie Amuro place of birth</search>\n    reasoning_quality: Logical and effective. The agent correctly identified the need to find the performer first and then her place of birth. The reasoning chain was clear and well-structured.\n    answer_quality: The final answer was correct in terms of the information provided, but it did not match the ground truth. The answer should have been more aligned with the ground truth options to achieve a match.\n    key_learnings:\n      - When searching for information, consider multiple possible answers in the ground truth and ensure the search query is precise enough to capture all relevant information.\n      - The strategy of breaking down the problem into smaller steps (identifying the performer and then her place of birth) was effective but the specific query for the place of birth could have been refined to include more options.\n  iteration: 4\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Sapporo, Hokkaid\u014d, Japan\n    ground_truth:\n      - Naha\n      - Naha, Japan\n      - Naha, Okinawa\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: False\n    subem_match: False\n    failure_reason: Answer 'Sapporo, Hokkaid\u014d, Japan' does not match any of ['Naha', 'Naha, Japan', 'Naha, Okinawa']\n  source_entry_labels:\n\n  operator_name: plan\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\nRules:\n1. Both answers below are WRONG \u2014 NEVER give either of them as your answer.\n2. The information that led to those wrong answers may be incorrect \u2014 verify everything.\n3. Look at what useful facts each attempt found, but do NOT trust their conclusions.\n4. Try NEW search queries to find information that both attempts missed.\n5. Carefully check dates, names, and facts before concluding.\n6. Put your final answer inside <answer>...</answer> tags.\n"
