For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: What is the place of birth of the performer of song Heaven (Namie Amuro Song)?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  A brute-force strategy involves querying a comprehensive database of song lyrics and performer information to find the song 'Heaven' by Namie Amuro and then extracting the performer's place of birth. This approach relies on structured data storage and efficient search algorithms. The time complexity is O(n) where n is the number of records in the database, and the space complexity is O(1) since it does not require additional space beyond the database query.\n",
