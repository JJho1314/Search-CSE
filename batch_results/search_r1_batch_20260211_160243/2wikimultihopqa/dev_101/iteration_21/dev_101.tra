The agent refined the search queries to be more precise by using 'performer of Heaven song by Namie Amuro' and 'Namie Amuro place of birth'.

However, the search results were still not in the exact format expected by the ground truth.\n    answer_quality: The answer 'Naha, Okinawa, Japan' directly addresses the question and is correct based on the information found.
