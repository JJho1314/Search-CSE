After reasoning, if you find you lack some knowledge, you can call a search engine by <search> query </search> and it will return the top searched results between <information> and </information>. You can search as many times as you want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: What is the place of birth of the performer of song Heaven (Namie Amuro Song)?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  A machine learning-based strategy utilizes a trained model to predict the place of birth of Namie Amuro based on a dataset of similar examples. The model could be a neural network trained on attributes such as name, career timeline, and public records. The time complexity for querying the model is O(1), and the space complexity is O(1) for the inference, but the training phase has a complexity of O(n) where n is the number of training examples.\n"
