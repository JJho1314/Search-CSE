For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: What is the place of birth of the performer of song Heaven (Namie Amuro Song)?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  A hybrid approach combines a pre-built index of performer names with a detailed database of their biographical information. Using a hash table to map performer names to their biographical details, we can quickly locate the entry for Namie Amuro and retrieve her place of birth. The expected time complexity is O(1) for lookups, and the space complexity is O(n) where n is the number of performers in the database.\n",
