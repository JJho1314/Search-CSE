After reasoning, if you find you lack some knowledge, you can call a search engine by <search> query </search> and it will return the top searched results between <information> and </information>. You can search as many times as you want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: What is the place of birth of the performer of song Heaven (Namie Amuro Song)?\n\nIMPORTANT: Your previous attempt gave a WRONG answer. The previous attempt is shown below.\nYou MUST NOT repeat the same wrong answer. The answer shown below is INCORRECT.\nTry completely different search queries and reasoning to find the correct answer.\n\n### SOURCE TRAJECTORY SUMMARY\n  iter2_sol7\n  label: iter2_sol7\n  solution:\n  ```\n  <think>I need to find the place of birth of Namie Amuro, the performer of the song \"Heaven\". I will search for Namie Amuro's place of birth directly.</think>\n  <search>Namie Amuro place of birth</search>\n  <information>\n  Namie Amuro was born in Naha, Okinawa, Japan.\n  </information>\n  <think>The search result confirms that Namie Amuro was born in Naha, Okinawa, Japan. Since the question asks for the place of birth, I will provide it as 'Naha'.</think>\n  <answer>Naha</answer>\n  ```\n  metric: 1.0\n  summary:\n    solution_name: direct_search\n    approach_summary: The agent started by reasoning about the need to find Namie Amuro's place of birth, then conducted a direct search for this information. The search returned the correct place of birth, and the agent provided the answer as 'Naha' in the exact format required.\n    search_queries:\n      - <search>Namie Amuro place of birth</search>\n    reasoning_quality: Logical reasoning was used to deduce that the place of birth needed to be provided as 'Naha', which matched the ground truth.\n    answer_quality: The final answer 'Naha' directly addresses the question and matches the ground truth exactly, achieving an exact match (EM) score of 1.0.\n    key_learnings:\n      - Direct search queries can efficiently lead to the correct answer when the question is specific and directly answerable.\n      - Ensure the answer format matches the ground truth exactly.\n      - Iterative refinement of search queries is important to cover all necessary details.\n  iteration: 22\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Naha\n    ground_truth:\n      - Naha\n      - Naha, Japan\n      - Naha, Okinawa\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: True\n    subem_match: True\n  source_entry_labels:\n    - iter2_sol6\n  operator_name: reflection_refine\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\nRules:\n1. The answer in the previous attempt is WRONG — NEVER give that same answer again.\n2. The information that led to that wrong answer may also be wrong — do NOT trust it.\n3. Use DIFFERENT search queries than what was tried before. Search for each entity separately.\n4. Carefully check dates, names, and facts in the search results before concluding.\n5.
