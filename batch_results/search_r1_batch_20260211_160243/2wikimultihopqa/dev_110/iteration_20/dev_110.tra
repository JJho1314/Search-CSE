The agent then used this information to deduce that Van Rensselaer's father must be from the Netherlands.\n    search_queries:\n      - <search>Jan Baptist Van Rensselaer father country</search>\n      - <search>Jan Baptist Van Rensselaer father origin</search>\n    reasoning_quality: Logical. The agent correctly used the search results to deduce the correct answer, even though the origin was not explicitly stated in the search result.\n    answer_quality: 1.0\n    key_learnings: The agent improved by refining the search query and using additional context. For similar questions, it is beneficial to search with more specific terms and use contextual information to infer the correct answer.\n  iteration: 12\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Netherlands\n    ground_truth:\n      - Holland\n      - the Netherlands\n      - NED\n      - Netherlands (after 1945)\n      - Netherlands\n      - NL\n      - Nederland\n      - \ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddf1\n      - Dutch\n      - nl\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: True\n    subem_match: True\n  source_entry_labels:\n    - iter1_sol5\n  operator_name: reflection_refine\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\nRules:\n1.
