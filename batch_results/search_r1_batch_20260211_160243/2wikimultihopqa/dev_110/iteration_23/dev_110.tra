After reasoning, if you find you lack some knowledge, you can call a search engine by <search> query </search> and it will return the top searched results between <information> and </information>. You can search as many times as you want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Which country Jan Baptist Van Rensselaer's father is from?\n\nIMPORTANT: Two previous attempts are shown below. BOTH gave WRONG answers.\nYou MUST NOT repeat either wrong answer. Both answers shown below are INCORRECT.\nUse any useful search results from both attempts, but reach a DIFFERENT conclusion.\n\n### TRAJECTORY 1 SUMMARY\n  iter2_sol4\n  label: iter2_sol4\n  solution:\n  ```\n  <think>Based on the previous attempts, I know that Jan Baptist Van Rensselaer was from the Netherlands.

The agent then correctly deduced that Frederick Adolph Van Rensselaer, and thus Jan Baptist Van Rensselaer's father, was from the Netherlands. The reasoning followed a logical path from the search query to the final answer, and the strategy was consistent with the previous attempt.\n    search_queries:\n      - <search>Fredrick Adolph Van Rensselaer origin</search>\n    reasoning_quality: Logical. The agent correctly deduced the correct answer based on the search results, ensuring that the reasoning followed a logical path from the search query to the final answer.\n    answer_quality: 1.0\n    key_learnings: This approach is effective for questions where the initial information is insufficient. Starting with a targeted search and then confirming the details is a reliable strategy. The agent could benefit from exploring alternative names or aliases for the individual in future searches to ensure comprehensive coverage.\n  iteration: 19\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Netherlands\n    ground_truth:\n      - Holland\n      - the Netherlands\n      - NED\n      - Netherlands (after 1945)\n      - Netherlands\n      - NL\n      - Nederland\n      - \ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddf1\n      - Dutch\n      - nl\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: True\n    subem_match: True\n  source_entry_labels:\n    - iter2_sol1\n    - iter1_sol4\n  operator_name: crossover\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\n### TRAJECTORY 2 SUMMARY\n  iter1_sol5\n  label: iter1_sol5\n  solution:\n  ```\n  <think>Jan Baptist Van Rensselaer's father is from which country?

The search returned relevant information about Van Rensselaer being a Dutch colonial administrator. Using this information, the agent deduced that his father was from the Netherlands and provided this as the final answer.\n    search_queries:\n      - <search>Jan Baptist Van Rensselaer father country</search>\n    reasoning_quality: Logical. The agent used the information from the search result to deduce the correct answer.\n    answer_quality: 1.0\n    key_learnings: The approach was effective as it leveraged the search results to find the correct information. For similar questions, directly searching for the name and the query related to the specific attribute (in this case, the father's country) is a straightforward and efficient strategy.\n  iteration: 5\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Netherlands\n    ground_truth:\n      - Holland\n      - the Netherlands\n      - NED\n      - Netherlands (after 1945)\n      - Netherlands\n      - NL\n      - Nederland\n      - \ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddf1\n      - Dutch\n      - nl\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: True\n    subem_match: True\n  source_entry_labels:\n\n  operator_name: plan\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\nRules:\n1.
