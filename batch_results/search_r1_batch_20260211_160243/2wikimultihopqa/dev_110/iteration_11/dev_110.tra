The agent used a search query to find details about the father's origin and then deduced the correct answer based on the information retrieved.

To confirm this, the agent performed a search on 'Jan Baptist Van Rensselaer father origin' and found that his father was Frederick Adolph Van Rensselaer, a Dutch merchant and colonist.
