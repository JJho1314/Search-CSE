New Netherland was a Dutch colony, so it is likely that his father was from the Netherlands.

Therefore, his father is from the Netherlands.</think>\n  <answer>Netherlands</answer>\n  ```\n  metric: 1.0\n  summary:\n    solution_name: multi_hop_v2\n    approach_summary: The agent started with a search query to find information about Jan Baptist Van Rensselaer and his origin. Since the initial search did not provide direct information about his father, the agent conducted a second search to confirm the father's origin, which was found to be the Netherlands.\n    search_queries:\n      - Jan Baptist Van Rensselaer's father's origin\n      - Jan Baptist Van Rensselaer father origin\n    reasoning_quality: Logical and effective. The agent correctly identified the need to search for additional information and efficiently used the search results to piece together the required information.\n    answer_quality: 1.0\n    key_learnings:\n      - The use of multiple search queries to gather necessary information is effective, especially when the initial query does not provide sufficient details.\n      - Confirming secondary information (father's name, position, etc.) helps in validating the country of origin.\n  iteration: 4\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Netherlands\n    ground_truth:\n      - Holland\n      - the Netherlands\n      - NED\n      - Netherlands (after 1945)\n      - Netherlands\n      - NL\n      - Nederland\n      - 🇳🇱\n      - Dutch\n      - nl\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: True\n    subem_match: True\n  source_entry_labels:\n\n  operator_name: plan\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\nRules:\n1. The answer in the previous attempt is WRONG — NEVER give that same answer again.\n2. The information that led to that wrong answer may also be wrong — do NOT trust it.\n3.
