The previous attempt is shown below.\nYou MUST NOT repeat the same wrong answer. The answer shown below is INCORRECT.\nTry completely different search queries and reasoning to find the correct answer.\n\n### SOURCE TRAJECTORY SUMMARY\n  iter3_sol1\n  label: iter3_sol1\n  solution:\n  ```\n  <think>Since Jan Baptist Van Rensselaer's father was Pieter van Rensselaer, I need to find out the origin of Pieter van Rensselaer.

The reasoning was straightforward and logical, confirming that since Pieter van Rensselaer was a Dutch patroon, his origin must be the Netherlands. Despite repeating the same search queries, the agent successfully deduced the correct answer through careful reasoning.\n    search_queries:\n      - <search>Pieter van Rensselaer origin</search>\n    reasoning_quality: Logical. The agent correctly used the search results to deduce the correct answer, confirming that Pieter van Rensselaer was from the Netherlands.\n    answer_quality: 1.0\n    key_learnings: The agent effectively used a direct search with additional context to find the correct answer. This approach can be beneficial for similar questions where the direct origin may not be explicitly stated but can be inferred from related information. It is crucial to carefully check and reason through the search results, even if the queries are similar to previous ones.\n  iteration: 26\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Netherlands\n    ground_truth:\n      - Holland\n      - the Netherlands\n      - NED\n      - Netherlands (after 1945)\n      - Netherlands\n      - NL\n      - Nederland\n      - 🇳🇱\n      - Dutch\n      - nl\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: True\n    subem_match: True\n  source_entry_labels:\n    - iter2_sol6\n  operator_name: reflection_refine\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\nRules:\n1.
