After determining the release years through separate searches, the agent correctly reasoned that 'Sathyavan Savithri' was released earlier than 'Kids Of The Round Table'. However, the agent's answer was incorrect because it did not match the expected format or possibly the specific titles as mentioned in the ground truth.\n    search_queries:\n      - <search>release year of Sathyavan Savithri</search>\n      - <search>release year of Kids Of The Round Table</search>\n    reasoning_quality: Logical and effective. The agent correctly sorted and compared the release years of the films after obtaining the necessary information.\n    answer_quality: The answer 'Sathyavan Savithri' is correct in content but incorrect in format. The ground truth expected a specific title, possibly 'Kids of the Round Table', which the agent failed to match.\n    key_learnings:\n      - Ensure that the answer format matches the expected format in the ground truth.\n      - Double-check the titles and names in the search queries to avoid discrepancies.\n      - Consider the context of the question and the expected answer format before finalizing the response.\n  iteration: 2\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Sathyavan Savithri\n    ground_truth:\n      - Kids of the Round Table\n      - Kids Of The Round Table\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: False\n    subem_match: False\n    failure_reason: Answer 'Sathyavan Savithri' does not match any of ['Kids of the Round Table', 'Kids Of The Round Table']\n  source_entry_labels:\n\n  operator_name: plan\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\nRules:\n1. The answer in the previous attempt is WRONG — NEVER give that same answer again.\n2. The information that led to that wrong answer may also be wrong — do NOT trust it.\n3. Use DIFFERENT search queries than what was tried before. Search for each entity separately.\n4. Carefully check dates, names, and facts in the search results before concluding.\n5.
