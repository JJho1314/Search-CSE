You can search as many times as you want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Which film was released earlier, Sathyavan Savithri or Kids Of The Round Table?\n\nIMPORTANT: Your previous attempt gave a WRONG answer. The previous attempt is shown below.\nYou MUST NOT repeat the same wrong answer. The answer shown below is INCORRECT.\nTry completely different search queries and reasoning to find the correct answer.\n\n### SOURCE TRAJECTORY SUMMARY\n  iter1_sol1\n  label: iter1_sol1\n  solution:\n  ```\n  <think>\n  To determine which film was released earlier, I need to know the release years of both films. Let's start by searching for the release years of \"Sathyavan Savithri\" and \"Kids Of The Round Table\".\n  </think>\n  <search>Sathyavan Savithri release year</search>\n  <information>\n  [No suitable direct results for \"Sathyavan Savithri release year\"]\n  </information>\n  <search>Kids Of The Round Table release year</search>\n  <information>\n  [No suitable direct results for \"Kids Of The Round Table release year\"]\n  </information>\n  <think>\n  It seems I couldn't find the release year for either film directly. Since the release year is necessary to compare which film was released earlier, I need to search for more context or a combined result that includes both films' release years.\n  </think>\n  <search>release years of Sathyavan Savithri and Kids Of The Round Table</search>\n  <information>\n  [information> Sathyavan Savithri (1992)\n  Kids Of The Round Table (2000)</information>\n  </think>\n  <answer>Sathyavan Savithri</answer>\n  ```\n  metric: 0.0\n  summary:\n    solution_name: multi_hop_v2\n    approach_summary: The agent initially tried to find the release years of both films directly but couldn't find any suitable results. It then combined the search terms to find the release years of both films together. The reasoning was logical, but the agent did not consider the possibility of multiple correct answers or that the question could be interpreted in multiple ways.\n    search_queries:\n      - <search>Sathyavan Savithri release year</search>\n      - <search>Kids Of The Round Table release year</search>\n      - <search>release years of Sathyavan Savithri and Kids Of The Round Table</search>\n    reasoning_quality: Logical but missed the possibility of multiple correct answers. The agent assumed there would be one correct answer and did not account for the possibility of both films being correct depending on the context or the question's interpretation.\n    answer_quality: The answer 'Sathyavan Savithri' is correct and directly addresses the question, but it is not complete because the question asks for both films' release dates. The agent should recognize that 'Kids Of The Round Table' was also released earlier than some other films not mentioned in the question but relevant to the context.\n    key_learnings:\n      - The agent should consider the possibility of multiple correct answers or multiple ways to interpret the question.\n      - When searching for specific information, it's important to try different combinations of search terms to get more relevant results.\n      - The reasoning chain should be more thorough to cover all potential outcomes of the search results.\n  iteration: 1\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Sathyavan Savithri\n    ground_truth:\n      - Kids of the Round Table\n      - Kids Of The Round Table\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: False\n    subem_match: False\n    failure_reason: Answer 'Sathyavan Savithri' does not match any of ['Kids of the Round Table', 'Kids Of The Round Table']\n  source_entry_labels:\n\n  operator_name: plan\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\nRules:\n1. The answer in the previous attempt is WRONG — NEVER give that same answer again.\n2. The information that led to that wrong answer may also be wrong — do NOT trust it.\n3. Use DIFFERENT search queries than what was tried before. Search for each entity separately.\n4. Carefully check dates, names, and facts in the search results before concluding.\n5. Put your final answer inside <answer>...</answer> tags.\n",
