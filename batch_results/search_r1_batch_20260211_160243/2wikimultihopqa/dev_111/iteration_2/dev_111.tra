You can search as many times as you want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Which film was released earlier, Sathyavan Savithri or Kids Of The Round Table?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  Sort a list of tuples containing the names and release years of both films. Then, compare the release years to determine which film was released earlier. This strategy employs a sorting algorithm with a time complexity of O(n log n), where n is the number of films (in this case, n = 2), and a space complexity of O(n) for storing the list of tuples.\n"
