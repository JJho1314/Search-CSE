However, no clear information was found for Sathyavan Savithri, and thus the agent had to rely on the available data, which suggested that Sathyavan Savithri was likely released before 1995. Despite the lack of definitive information, the agent provided an answer based on the available data.\n    search_queries:\n      - <search>release year of Sathyavan Savithri</search>\n      - <search>release year of Kids Of The Round Table</search>\n    reasoning_quality: The reasoning was partially logical but lacked sufficient evidence. The agent assumed Sathyavan Savithri was released before 1995 without concrete proof, which led to an incorrect answer.\n    answer_quality: 0.0\n    key_learnings:\n      - When critical information is unavailable, the agent should either admit the lack of data or seek alternative methods to verify the information.\n      - The agent should attempt to cross-reference findings with other available data to ensure the answer's correctness.\n      - Direct searches may not always yield complete information, and the agent should be prepared to handle such cases by exploring other possible information sources or methods.\n  iteration: 5\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Sathyavan Savithri\n    ground_truth:\n      - Kids of the Round Table\n      - Kids Of The Round Table\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: False\n    subem_match: False\n    failure_reason: Answer 'Sathyavan Savithri' does not match any of ['Kids of the Round Table', 'Kids Of The Round Table']\n  source_entry_labels:\n\n  operator_name: plan\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\n### TRAJECTORY 2 SUMMARY\n  iter1_sol2\n  label: iter1_sol2\n  solution:\n  ```\n  <think>\n  The question asks to compare the release dates of \"Sathyavan Savithri\" and \"Kids Of The Round Table\".

After determining the release years through separate searches, the agent correctly reasoned that 'Sathyavan Savithri' was released earlier than 'Kids Of The Round Table'. However, the agent's answer was incorrect because it did not match the expected format or possibly the specific titles as mentioned in the ground truth.\n    search_queries:\n      - <search>release year of Sathyavan Savithri</search>\n      - <search>release year of Kids Of The Round Table</search>\n    reasoning_quality: Logical and effective. The agent correctly sorted and compared the release years of the films after obtaining the necessary information.\n    answer_quality: The answer 'Sathyavan Savithri' is correct in content but incorrect in format. The ground truth expected a specific title, possibly 'Kids of the Round Table', which the agent failed to match.\n    key_learnings:\n      - Ensure that the answer format matches the expected format in the ground truth.\n      - Double-check the titles and names in the search queries to avoid discrepancies.\n      - Consider the context of the question and the expected answer format before finalizing the response.\n  iteration: 2\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Sathyavan Savithri\n    ground_truth:\n      - Kids of the Round Table\n      - Kids Of The Round Table\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: False\n    subem_match: False\n    failure_reason: Answer 'Sathyavan Savithri' does not match any of ['Kids of the Round Table', 'Kids Of The Round Table']\n  source_entry_labels:\n\n  operator_name: plan\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\nRules:\n1.
