You can search as many times as you want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Which film was released earlier, Sathyavan Savithri or Kids Of The Round Table?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  Implement a linear search to compare the release years of the two films. This method iterates through the list of films once, comparing the release years to determine the earlier release. The time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of films (2), and the space complexity is O(1) as no additional data structures are used.\n"
