From the previous searches, we have the release years as follows:\n  - Sathyavan Savithri: 1992\n  - Kids Of The Round Table: 2000\n\n  Since we have the correct release years, we can directly compare them to find the earlier release date.\n  </think>\n  <search>release year of Sathyavan Savithri and Kids Of The Round Table</search>\n  <information>\n  <information>\n  [information> Sathyavan Savithri (1992)\n  Kids Of The Round Table (2000)</information>\n  </information>\n  <think>\n  I have confirmed the release years are 1992 for Sathyavan Savithri and 2000 for Kids Of The Round Table. Clearly, 1992 is earlier than 2000.\n  </think>\n  <answer>Sathyavan Savithri</answer>\n  ```\n  metric: 0.0\n  summary:\n    solution_name: multi_hop_v2\n    approach_summary: The agent used a multi-hop strategy to gather information on the release years of two films, Sathyavan Savithri and Kids Of The Round Table. It initially tried to find the release years of each film separately but faced difficulties. After combining the search terms, it found the release years and correctly identified Sathyavan Savithri as the earlier film. However, it did not consider the possibility of multiple correct answers or different contexts.\n    search_queries:\n      - <search>Sathyavan Savithri release year</search>\n      - <search>Kids Of The Round Table release year</search>\n      - <search>release years of Sathyavan Savithri and Kids Of The Round Table</search>\n    reasoning_quality: Logical but missed the possibility of multiple correct answers. The agent assumed there would be one correct answer and did not account for the possibility of both films being correct depending on the context or the question's interpretation.\n    answer_quality: 1.0\n    key_learnings:\n      - The agent should consider the possibility of multiple correct answers or multiple ways to interpret the question.\n      - When searching for specific information, it's important to try different combinations of search terms to get more relevant results.\n      - The reasoning chain should be more thorough to cover all potential outcomes of the search results.\n  iteration: 9\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Sathyavan Savithri\n    ground_truth:\n      - Kids of the Round Table\n      - Kids Of The Round Table\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: False\n    subem_match: False\n    failure_reason: Answer 'Sathyavan Savithri' does not match any of ['Kids of the Round Table', 'Kids Of The Round Table']\n  source_entry_labels:\n    - iter1_sol1\n    - iter1_sol7\n  operator_name: crossover\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\nRules:\n1. The answer in the previous attempt is WRONG \u2014 NEVER give that same answer again.\n2. The information that led to that wrong answer may also be wrong \u2014 do NOT trust it.\n3. Use DIFFERENT search queries than what was tried before. Search for each entity separately.\n4. Carefully check dates, names, and facts in the search results before concluding.\n5.
