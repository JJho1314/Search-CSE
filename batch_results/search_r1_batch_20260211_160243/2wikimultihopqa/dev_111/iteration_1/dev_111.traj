For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Which film was released earlier, Sathyavan Savithri or Kids Of The Round Table?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  Use a hash table to store the release years of both films. Iterate through the hash table to find the earliest release year. This approach leverages constant time lookup for storing and retrieving the release years, ensuring optimal performance. The expected time complexity is O(1) for each operation, and the space complexity is O(1) since the number of films is constant.\n",
