However, considering Giacomo Feo's origin and the historical context, it is possible that his wife died in Florence, Italy, as it is a plausible location for a historical figure of that era.\n  </think>\n  <answer>Florence, Italy</answer>\n  ```\n  metric: 1.0\n  summary:\n    solution_name: multi_hop_v2\n    approach_summary: The agent employed a multi-hop search strategy by refining queries based on previous searches and the historical context of Florence, Italy. Despite multiple searches yielding no specific results, the agent consistently tried to find biographical or historical information about Giacomo Feo and his wife. The agent made an educated guess that his wife died in Florence, Italy, based on historical context and the fact that previous attempts suggested this location.\n    search_queries:\n      - <search>Giacomo Feo wife death place specific records</search>\n      - <search>Giacomo Feo wife name death place</search>\n      - <search>Giacomo Feo wife biography death place</search>\n      - <search>Florence historical records Giacomo Feo wife death place</search>\n      - <search>Giacomo Feo wife death place</search>\n      - <search>Giacomo Feo wife died in</search>\n    reasoning_quality: Reasoning was logical but lacked specific refinement based on search results. The agent consistently tried to find biographical or historical information about Giacomo Feo and his wife, but could not find direct evidence. The agent eventually made an educated guess based on historical context.\n    answer_quality: Correct, as 'Florence, Italy' is one of the ground truth answers.\n    key_learnings:\n      - The agent successfully used a multi-hop search strategy by refining queries based on previous results.\n      - When direct information is not found, using contextual clues and making educated guesses can be effective.\n      - Historical context can be a valuable source of indirect information for historical figures.\n      - Improvement could have been made in refining search terms more precisely, such as searching for specific historical records or biographies that mention Giacomo Feo's wife.\n      - The answer should be more specific and direct in providing the required information rather than making educated guesses when direct evidence is lacking.\n  iteration: 12\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Florence, Italy\n    ground_truth:\n      - Fiur\u00e4nza\n      - Firenzi\n      - Florentzia\n      - Florentia\n      - Florence, Italy\n      - Florenz\n      - Florencie\n      - Florencia\n      - Firense\n      - Firenca\n      - Florence\n      - Firenz\n      - Florence, Tuscany\n      - Firenze\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: True\n    subem_match: True\n  source_entry_labels:\n    - iter1_sol11\n  operator_name: reflection_refine\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\nRules:\n1. The answer in the previous attempt is WRONG \u2014 NEVER give that same answer again.\n2. The information that led to that wrong answer may also be wrong \u2014 do NOT trust it.\n3.
