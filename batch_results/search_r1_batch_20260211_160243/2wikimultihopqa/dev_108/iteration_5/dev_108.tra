For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Where did Giacomo Feo's wife die?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  A Bloom filter can be used to check if a record for Giacomo Feo's wife exists in a large database without storing the full records. This method provides fast lookups with a space complexity of O(n) where n is the number of records and a time complexity of O(1) for each search. However, it allows for false positives, so additional verification steps may be needed to ensure accuracy.\n"
