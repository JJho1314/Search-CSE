For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Where did Giacomo Feo's wife die?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  Using an index or a binary search tree (BST) on a sorted list of records would allow for efficient searching by the wife's name. The search operation would have a time complexity of O(log n) due to the BST's properties. The space complexity remains O(n) for the BST, similar to the hash map strategy.\n"
