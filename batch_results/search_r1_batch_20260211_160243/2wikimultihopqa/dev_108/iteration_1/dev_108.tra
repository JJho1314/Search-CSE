You can search as many times as you want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Where did Giacomo Feo's wife die?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  A brute-force approach involves iterating through a database or list of records to find the entry corresponding to Giacomo Feo's wife and extract the location of her death. This method is simple but inefficient with a time complexity of O(n) where n is the number of records. The space complexity is O(1) as it doesn't require additional storage beyond the input and output variables.\n"
