After reasoning, if you find you lack some knowledge, you can call a search engine by <search> query </search> and it will return the top searched results between <information> and </information>. You can search as many times as you want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Where did Giacomo Feo's wife die?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  A hash map can be used to store the records of Giacomo Feo's wife and their corresponding locations of death. Iterating through the map once to find the required information has a time complexity of O(1) on average due to hash map lookup. The space complexity is O(n) where n is the number of records, as each record requires storage in the hash map.\n"
