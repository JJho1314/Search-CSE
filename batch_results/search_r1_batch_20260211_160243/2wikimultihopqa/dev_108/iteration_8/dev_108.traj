Despite multiple searches yielding no specific information, the agent made an educated guess based on the historical context and the suggestions from previous attempts.\n    search_queries:\n      - <search>Giacomo Feo wife death place Florence Italy</search>\n      - <search>historical records Giacomo Feo wife death place</search>\n      - <search>death records Florence Giacomo Feo wife</search>\n    reasoning_quality: Reasoning was logical but suffered from a lack of specific refinements based on search results. The agent consistently tried to find biographical or historical information about Giacomo Feo and his wife, but could not find direct evidence. The agent eventually made an educated guess based on historical context.\n    answer_quality: Correct, as 'Florence, Italy' is one of the ground truth answers.\n    key_learnings:\n      - The agent successfully used a multi-hop search strategy by refining queries based on previous results.\n      - When direct information is not found, using contextual clues and making educated guesses can be effective.\n      - Historical context can be a valuable source of indirect information for historical figures.\n      - Improvement could have been made in refining search terms more precisely, such as searching for specific historical records or biographies that mention Giacomo Feo's wife.\n      - The answer should be more specific and direct in providing the required information rather than making educated guesses when direct evidence is lacking.\n  iteration: 7\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Florence, Italy\n    ground_truth:\n      - Fiuränza\n      - Firenzi\n      - Florentzia\n      - Florentia\n      - Florence, Italy\n      - Florenz\n      - Florencie\n      - Florencia\n      - Firense\n      - Firenca\n      - Florence\n      - Firenz\n      - Florence, Tuscany\n      - Firenze\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: True\n    subem_match: True\n  source_entry_labels:\n    - iter1_sol6\n    - iter1_sol5\n  operator_name: crossover\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\nRules:\n1. The answer in the previous attempt is WRONG — NEVER give that same answer again.\n2. The information that led to that wrong answer may also be wrong — do NOT trust it.\n3.
