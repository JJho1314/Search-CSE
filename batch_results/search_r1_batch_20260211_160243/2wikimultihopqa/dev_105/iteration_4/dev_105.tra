For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Where does Huma Abedin's husband work at?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  Utilize a graph database to model the relationships between public figures and their workplaces. Query the database to find the connection between Huma Abedin and her husband, extracting the relevant workplace details. This approach involves a graph traversal, resulting in a time complexity of O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges, and the space complexity is O(V) for storing the graph structure.\n"
