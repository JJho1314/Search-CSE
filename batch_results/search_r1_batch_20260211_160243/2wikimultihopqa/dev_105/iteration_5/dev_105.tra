For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Where does Huma Abedin's husband work at?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  Implement a machine learning model trained on publicly available data about public figures' work details. The model predicts Huma Abedin's husband's workplace based on input features such as names, relationships, and other relevant metadata. Training the model has a time complexity of O(d^2n), where d is the dimensionality of the input features and n is the number of training samples, with a space complexity of O(dn) for storing the model weights. Inference is faster, with a time complexity of O(d) and space complexity of O(d) for storing the input features.\n"
