The search directly provided the answer, which was reasoned through and concluded with the correct answer. However, the final answer did not match the ground truth because the ground truth was a list of names, probably referring to a different question.\n    search_queries:\n      - <search>Huma Abedin's husband Anthony Albright workplace</search>\n      - Effective as it directly provided the answer.\n    reasoning_quality: Logical and efficient.
