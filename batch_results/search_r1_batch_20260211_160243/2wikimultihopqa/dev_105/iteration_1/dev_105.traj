For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Where does Huma Abedin's husband work at?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  Retrieve Huma Abedin's husband's workplace from a reliable public source such as a recent news article, official biography, or social media profile. This approach relies on extracting information from a pre-existing and accurate data source. The time complexity is O(1) since the information is fetched directly without any computation, and the space complexity is also O(1) as no additional data structures are required beyond the result.\n",
