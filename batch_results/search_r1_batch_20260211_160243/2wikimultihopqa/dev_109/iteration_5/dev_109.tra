For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: What is the place of birth of the director of film Swedenhielms?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  Use a binary search algorithm to find the director of 'Swedenhielms' in a sorted list of directors' names. Once the director is found, retrieve their place of birth. Binary search has a time complexity of O(log n), where n is the number of directors in the list. Space complexity is O(n) for storing the list.\n"
