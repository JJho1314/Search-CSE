Then, it searched for his place of birth and initially found Jakobsberg. After a second search for alternative names and places of birth, the agent discovered that Victor Sjöström was also known as Viktor Sjöström and was born in Helsinki, Helsingia, and Helsingfors. The agent then reasoned that Helsinki was the most common and widely accepted place of birth and provided it as the final answer.\n    search_queries:\n      - <search>director of the film Swedenhielms</search>\n      - <search>place of birth of Victor Sjöström</search>\n      - <search>Victor Sjöström place of birth alternative names</search>\n    reasoning_quality: Logical and thorough. The agent correctly identified the need to search for alternative names and places of birth to ensure the most accurate answer.\n    answer_quality: The final answer 'Helsinki' directly addresses the question and matches the ground truth, although the agent initially found Jakobsberg and had to cross-check for the correct place of birth.\n    key_learnings:\n      - When searching for a person's place of birth, it is important to consider alternative names and places that might be associated with the same individual.\n      - Cross-referencing multiple sources can help in verifying and confirming the correct information.\n      - The agent successfully adapted the search strategy by considering multiple names and places, which led to the correct answer.\n  iteration: 6\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Helsinki\n    ground_truth:\n      - Helsinki\n      - Helsingia\n      - Helsingfors\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: True\n    subem_match: True\n  source_entry_labels:\n    - iter1_sol4\n  operator_name: reflection_refine\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\nRules:\n1.
