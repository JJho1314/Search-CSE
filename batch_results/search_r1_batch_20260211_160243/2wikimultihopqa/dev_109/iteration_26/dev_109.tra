The first search suggested Jakobsberg, Sweden, while the second suggested Helsinki, Finland. Given that he is Swedish and there are multiple aliases, let's verify the commonly accepted place of birth.\n  </think>\n  <search>commonly accepted place of birth Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m</search>\n  <information>\n  <information>\n  [s3] The commonly accepted place of birth for Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m is Helsinki, Finland.\n  </information>\n  <think>\n  Based on the search results, the commonly accepted place of birth for Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m is Helsinki, Finland.

Initially, the agent confirmed that the director was Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m and then searched for his place of birth. Due to conflicting information, the agent conducted additional searches to verify the commonly accepted place of birth, which ultimately led to the correct answer of Helsinki.\n    search_queries:\n      - <search>Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m place of birth</search>\n      - <search>commonly accepted place of birth Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m</search>\n    reasoning_quality: Logical and thorough. The agent correctly identified the need to search for multiple places of birth and then find the commonly accepted place of birth, avoiding the pitfalls of the previous incorrect answers.\n    answer_quality: The final answer 'Helsinki' directly addresses the question and matches the ground truth.\n    key_learnings:\n      - When searching for a person's place of birth, it is important to consider multiple places and verify the commonly accepted place of birth.\n      - Cross-referencing information from multiple sources can help in verifying the correct answer.\n      - The agent successfully adapted the search strategy by considering multiple names and places, which led to the correct answer.\n  iteration: 13\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Helsinki\n    ground_truth:\n      - Helsinki\n      - Helsingia\n      - Helsingfors\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: True\n    subem_match: True\n  source_entry_labels:\n    - iter1_sol7\n    - iter1_sol6\n  operator_name: crossover\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\nRules:\n1. The answer in the previous attempt is WRONG \u2014 NEVER give that same answer again.\n2. The information that led to that wrong answer may also be wrong \u2014 do NOT trust it.\n3. Use DIFFERENT search queries than what was tried before. Search for each entity separately.\n4. Carefully check dates, names, and facts in the search results before concluding.\n5.
