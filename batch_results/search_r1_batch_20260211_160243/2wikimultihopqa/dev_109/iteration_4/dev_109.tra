For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: What is the place of birth of the director of film Swedenhielms?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  Apply a hash set to store all unique directors' names. Use a linear search to find 'Swedenhielms' in the set. This method has a time complexity of O(n) in the worst case, where n is the number of directors. Space complexity is O(n), as we are storing each director's name once.\n"
