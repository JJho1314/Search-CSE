For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: What is the place of birth of the director of film Swedenhielms?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  Utilize a hash map to store the names of all directors and their corresponding films. Query the hash map to find the director of 'Swedenhielms', then retrieve their place of birth. This approach leverages the hash map for O(1) average-time complexity for lookups. Space complexity is O(n), where n is the number of directors.\n"
