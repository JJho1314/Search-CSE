For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: What is the place of birth of the director of film Swedenhielms?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  Employ a Trie (prefix tree) to store the names of all directors, allowing for efficient substring searches. For each film, check if 'Swedenhielms' is a prefix in the Trie. Once the director is found, access their place of birth. Time complexity for each insertion and search is O(m), where m is the length of the name. Overall space and time complexity depend on the number of directors and the length of their names.\n"
