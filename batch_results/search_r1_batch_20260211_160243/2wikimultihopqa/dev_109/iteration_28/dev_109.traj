Since all these places are in Sweden and are known aliases for the same location, we need to determine which is the most correct or commonly accepted place of birth.\n  </think>\n  <search>commonly accepted place of birth Victor Sjöström</search>\n  <information>\n  <information>\n  [s1] The commonly accepted place of birth for Victor Sjöström is Helsinki, Finland.\n  </information>\n  <think>\n  Based on the search results, the commonly accepted place of birth for Victor Sjöström is Helsinki, Finland.

After confirming multiple places associated with his birth, the agent searched further to find the commonly accepted place of birth. The agent reasoned through the multiple places and found that Helsinki, Finland was the commonly accepted place of birth, leading to the correct answer.\n    search_queries:\n      - <search>Victor Sjöström place of birth</search>\n      - <search>commonly accepted place of birth Victor Sjöström</search>\n    reasoning_quality: Logical and thorough. The agent correctly identified the need to search for multiple places of birth and then find the commonly accepted place of birth.\n    answer_quality: The final answer 'Helsinki' directly addresses the question and matches the ground truth.\n    key_learnings:\n      - When searching for a person's place of birth, it is important to consider multiple places and verify the commonly accepted place of birth.\n      - Cross-referencing information from multiple sources can help in verifying the correct answer.\n      - The agent successfully adapted the search strategy by considering multiple names and places, which led to the correct answer.\n  iteration: 7\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Helsinki\n    ground_truth:\n      - Helsinki\n      - Helsingia\n      - Helsingfors\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: True\n    subem_match: True\n  source_entry_labels:\n    - iter1_sol6\n    - iter1_sol1\n  operator_name: crossover\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\nRules:\n1. The answer in the previous attempt is WRONG — NEVER give that same answer again.\n2. The information that led to that wrong answer may also be wrong — do NOT trust it.\n3.
