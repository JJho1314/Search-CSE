For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: What is the place of birth of the director of film Swedenhielms?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  Implement a Binary Search Tree (BST) to store the directors' names in sorted order. Perform an in-order traversal to find the director of 'Swedenhielms' and retrieve their place of birth. Insertion and search operations in BST have an average time complexity of O(log n). However, worst-case time complexity can degrade to O(n) if the BST is unbalanced. Space complexity is O(n).\n"
