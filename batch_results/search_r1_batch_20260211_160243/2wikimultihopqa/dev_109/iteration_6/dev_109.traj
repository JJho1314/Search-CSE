You can search as many times as you want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: What is the place of birth of the director of film Swedenhielms?\n\nIMPORTANT: Your previous attempt gave a WRONG answer. The previous attempt is shown below.\nYou MUST NOT repeat the same wrong answer. The answer shown below is INCORRECT.\nTry completely different search queries and reasoning to find the correct answer.\n\n### SOURCE TRAJECTORY SUMMARY\n  iter1_sol4\n  label: iter1_sol4\n  solution:\n  ```\n  The question asks for the place of birth of the director of the film \"Swedenhielms.\" Let's begin by searching for the director's name and the film details.\n\n  <search>director of the film Swedenhielms</search>\n  <information>\n  [s0] Swedenhielms is a 1945 Swedish documentary film.\n  [s1] It was directed by Victor Sjöström.\n  </information>\n  <think>\n  From the search results, we learned that the film \"Swedenhielms\" was directed by Victor Sjöström. Now, we need to find out where Victor Sjöström was born.\n  </think>\n  <search>place of birth of Victor Sjöström</search>\n  <information>\n  [s2] Victor Sjöström was born in Jakobsberg, Sweden.\n  </information>\n  <think>\n  Victor Sjöström, the director of \"Swedenhielms,\" was born in Jakobsberg, Sweden.\n  </think>\n  <answer> Jakobsberg </answer>\n  ```\n  metric: 0.0\n  summary:\n    solution_name: direct_search\n    approach_summary: The agent first searched for the director of the film 'Swedenhielms' and found that Victor Sjöström directed it. Then, it searched for the place of birth of Victor Sjöström and found that he was born in Jakobsberg, Sweden. The reasoning was logical and followed step-by-step. However, the final answer did not match the provided ground truth due to a mismatch in place names.\n    search_queries:\n      - <search>director of the film Swedenhielms</search>\n      - <search>place of birth of Victor Sjöström</search>\n    reasoning_quality: Logical and clear. The agent correctly deduced that the place of birth of the director would be the answer to the question.\n    answer_quality: The answer 'Jakobsberg' is correct based on the information found, but it did not match the provided ground truth which included 'Helsinki', 'Helsingia', and 'Helsingfors'. This suggests a potential mismatch in the expected answer format or ambiguity in the place name.\n    key_learnings:\n      - When searching for a person's place of birth, ensure the correct name is used (e.g., Victor Sjöström vs. Sjöström).\n      - Be cautious of potential name variations or different spelling conventions that might cause a mismatch between search results and expected answers.\n      - In cases where the expected answer format or place names might be ambiguous, consider multiple search terms or cross-referencing with additional sources.\n  iteration: 4\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Jakobsberg\n    ground_truth:\n      - Helsinki\n      - Helsingia\n      - Helsingfors\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: False\n    subem_match: False\n    failure_reason: Answer 'Jakobsberg' does not match any of ['Helsinki', 'Helsingia', 'Helsingfors']\n  source_entry_labels:\n\n  operator_name: plan\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\nRules:\n1. The answer in the previous attempt is WRONG — NEVER give that same answer again.\n2. The information that led to that wrong answer may also be wrong — do NOT trust it.\n3. Use DIFFERENT search queries than what was tried before. Search for each entity separately.\n4. Carefully check dates, names, and facts in the search results before concluding.\n5. Put your final answer inside <answer>...</answer> tags.\n",
