For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Which film came out earlier, Out Of The Rain or Les Résultats Du Féminisme?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  Utilize a Trie (prefix tree) to store the film titles. Insert both titles into the Trie and then traverse to find the lexicographically smaller title, which corresponds to the earlier release date. The time complexity for insertion and search in a Trie is O(m), where m is the length of the title, leading to a total complexity of O(2m) for both titles, and the space complexity is also O(m) for each title.\n",
