Despite multiple failed searches, the agent made an educated guess based on general knowledge about French feminist films and the context of cinema history.\n    search_queries:\n      - release year of Out Of The Rain\n      - release year of Les R\u00e9sultats Du F\u00e9minisme\n      - filmography database Out Of The Rain\n      - film history Out Of The Rain\n    search_queries_effectiveness:\n      - Unsuccessful, no suitable result found\n      - Unsuccessful, no suitable result found\n      - Unsuccessful, no suitable result found\n      - Unsuccessful, no suitable result found\n    reasoning_quality: The reasoning was logical but inefficient. The agent made a broad search and then tried to narrow it down, but the lack of specific results led to an educated guess rather than a direct answer.\n    answer_quality: The answer is correct, but it was not derived from factual search results. Instead, it was an educated guess based on context.\n    key_learnings:\n      - Direct factual searches for specific information often fail when dealing with less-known or obscure films.\n      - Educated guesses based on contextual knowledge can be useful if direct searches fail, but the agent should clarify this in reasoning.\n      - Expanding search queries with broader terms like 'film history' can sometimes yield results, but in this case, it did not.\n  iteration: 1\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Les R\u00e9sultats Du F\u00e9minisme\n    ground_truth:\n      - R\u00e9sultats du f\u00e9minisme\n      - Resultats du feminisme\n      - Les R\u00e9sultats du f\u00e9minisme\n      - Les Resultats du feminisme\n      - Les R\u00e9sultats Du F\u00e9minisme\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: True\n    subem_match: True\n  source_entry_labels:\n\n  operator_name: plan\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\nRules:\n1.
