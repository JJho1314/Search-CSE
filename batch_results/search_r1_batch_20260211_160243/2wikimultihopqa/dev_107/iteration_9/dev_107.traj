Instead, it was an educated guess based on context.\n    key_learnings:\n      - Direct factual searches for specific information often fail when dealing with less-known or obscure films.\n      - Educated guesses based on contextual knowledge can be useful if direct searches fail, but the agent should clarify this in reasoning.\n      - Expanding search queries with broader terms like 'film history' can sometimes yield results, but in this case, it did not.\n  iteration: 1\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Les Résultats Du Féminisme\n    ground_truth:\n      - Résultats du féminisme\n      - Resultats du feminisme\n      - Les Résultats du féminisme\n      - Les Resultats du feminisme\n      - Les Résultats Du Féminisme\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: True\n    subem_match: True\n  source_entry_labels:\n\n  operator_name: plan\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\n### TRAJECTORY 2 SUMMARY\n  iter1_sol8\n  label: iter1_sol8\n  solution:\n  ```\n  <think>\n  The question asks to determine which film came out earlier: \"Out Of The Rain\" or \"Les Résultats Du Féminisme\".
