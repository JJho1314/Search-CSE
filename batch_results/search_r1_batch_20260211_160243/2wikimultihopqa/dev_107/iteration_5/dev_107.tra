After reasoning, if you find you lack some knowledge, you can call a search engine by <search> query </search> and it will return the top searched results between <information> and </information>. You can search as many times as you want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Which film came out earlier, Out Of The Rain or Les R\u00e9sultats Du F\u00e9minisme?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  Implement a Trie (prefix tree) with a slight modification to store the release years directly. Insert the titles and their release years into the Trie and then traverse to find the earlier release date. This method combines the space efficiency of a Trie with the ability to store additional data, providing a time complexity of O(m) for insertion and O(1) for lookup, making it efficient for this specific problem.\n"
