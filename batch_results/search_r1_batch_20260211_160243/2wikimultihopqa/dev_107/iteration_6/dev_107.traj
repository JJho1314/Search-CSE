Since the films' release years are not provided directly, we need to search for their release years.\n  </think>\n  <search>release year of Out Of The Rain film</search>\n  <information>\n  [No reliable source found for \"Out Of The Rain\" film release year.]\n  </information>\n  <search>release year of Les Résultats Du Féminisme film</search>\n  <information>\n  [No reliable source found for \"Les Résultats Du Féminisme\" film release year.]\n  </information>\n  <think>\n  Since I couldn't find the release years of either film through my initial search, I need to make an educated guess based on the titles and the likelihood of them being from different decades. \"Les Résultats Du Féminisme\" is a French title which could be from the 1970s or 1980s. \"Out Of The Rain\" sounds more modern and could be from the 2000s or 2010s. Given this, \"Les Résultats Du Féminisme\" seems to be from an earlier period.\n  </think>\n  <answer>Les Résultats Du Féminisme</answer>\n  ```\n  metric: 1.0\n  summary:\n    solution_name: educated_guess_based_on_titles\n    approach_summary: The agent attempted to find the release years of both films but could not find reliable information online. Therefore, it made an educated guess based on the titles, reasoning that 'Les Résultats Du Féminisme' was likely from an earlier period than 'Out Of The Rain'.\n    search_queries:\n      - <search>release year of Out Of The Rain film</search>\n      - <search>release year of Les Résultats Du Féminisme film</search>\n    search_queries_effectiveness:\n      - Unsuccessful - No reliable source found\n      - Unsuccessful - No reliable source found\n    reasoning_quality: The reasoning was logical based on the titles, but it missed the actual release years which could have led to a more accurate answer.\n    answer_quality: The final answer correctly addresses the question, but it is based on an educated guess rather than factual information.\n    key_learnings:\n      - When direct information is not available, making educated guesses based on context can be a useful fallback, but it is important to acknowledge the uncertainty in such guesses.\n      - Improving the search strategy to better handle cases where direct information is not available could involve searching in multiple languages or using more specific search terms.\n  iteration: 4\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Les Résultats Du Féminisme\n    ground_truth:\n      - Résultats du féminisme\n      - Resultats du feminisme\n      - Les Résultats du féminisme\n      - Les Resultats du feminisme\n      - Les Résultats Du Féminisme\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: True\n    subem_match: True\n  source_entry_labels:\n\n  operator_name: plan\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\nRules:\n1.
