Given this, \"Les Résultats Du Féminisme\" seems to be from an earlier period.\n  </think>\n  <answer>Les Résultats Du Féminisme</answer>\n  ```\n  metric: 1.0\n  summary:\n    solution_name: educated_guess_based_on_titles\n    approach_summary: The agent attempted to find the release years of both films but could not find reliable information online.
