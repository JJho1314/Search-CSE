Despite multiple failed searches, the agent made an educated guess based on general knowledge about French feminist films and the context of cinema history.\n    search_queries:\n      - release year of Out Of The Rain\n      - release year of Les R\u00e9sultats Du F\u00e9minisme\n      - filmography database Out Of The Rain\n      - film history Out Of The Rain\n    search_queries_effectiveness:\n      - Unsuccessful, no suitable result found\n      - Unsuccessful, no suitable result found\n      - Unsuccessful, no suitable result found\n      - Unsuccessful, no suitable result found\n    reasoning_quality: The reasoning was logical but inefficient.
