Instead, it was an educated guess based on context.\n    key_learnings:\n      - Direct factual searches for specific information often fail when dealing with less-known or obscure films.\n      - Educated guesses based on contextual knowledge can be useful if direct searches fail, but the agent should clarify this in reasoning.\n      - Expanding search queries with broader terms like 'film history' or specific film databases can sometimes yield results, but in this case, it did not.\n      - The agent should have more clearly communicated that the final answer was an educated guess based on contextual knowledge rather than factual search results.\n  iteration: 20\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Les Résultats Du Féminisme\n    ground_truth:\n      - Résultats du féminisme\n      - Resultats du feminisme\n      - Les Résultats du féminisme\n      - Les Resultats du feminisme\n      - Les Résultats Du Féminisme\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: True\n    subem_match: True\n  source_entry_labels:\n    - iter1_sol10\n  operator_name: reflection_refine\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\nRules:\n1.
