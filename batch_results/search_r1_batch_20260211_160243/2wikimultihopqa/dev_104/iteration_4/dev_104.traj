A Trie is particularly effective for storing strings and allows for efficient prefix-based searches. For each band member, we insert their name and birthday into the Trie. To find the lead guitarist's birthday, we perform a search in the Trie. This approach has a time complexity of O(m) for insertion and O(m) for lookup, where m is the length of the name. The space complexity is O(n * m) due to the Trie structure.\n",
