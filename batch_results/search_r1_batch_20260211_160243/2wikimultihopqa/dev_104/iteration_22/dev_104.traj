This strategy involved breaking down the problem into smaller steps and using specific search queries to ensure accuracy.\n    search_queries:\n      - List Of The Dillinger Escape Plan band members\n      - Mike Patton birthday\n    reasoning_quality: The reasoning was logical and followed a structured approach. The agent correctly identified the need to find the lead guitarist and then their birthday, verifying the information by searching for the guitarist's birthday again.\n    answer_quality: The final answer 'August 8, 1975' directly addresses the question and matches the ground truth.\n    key_learnings:\n      - The importance of breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable steps and using specific search queries to ensure accuracy.\n      - The necessity of re-verifying the information to avoid repeating previous incorrect conclusions.\n      - Utilizing reliable sources like Wikipedia for accurate and up-to-date information.\n  iteration: 21\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: August 8, 1975\n    ground_truth:\n      - August 8, 1975\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: True\n    subem_match: True\n  source_entry_labels:\n    - iter1_sol8\n    - iter1_sol10\n  operator_name: crossover\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\nRules:\n1. The answer in the previous attempt is WRONG — NEVER give that same answer again.\n2. The information that led to that wrong answer may also be wrong — do NOT trust it.\n3. Use DIFFERENT search queries than what was tried before. Search for each entity separately.\n4. Carefully check dates, names, and facts in the search results before concluding.\n5.
