For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: When is the lead guitarist of List Of The Dillinger Escape Plan Band Members's birthday?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  For this problem, we can also use a simple linear search through the list of band members. Although this method is less efficient (O(n) time complexity), it is straightforward and requires no additional data structures. We iterate through the list of band members and compare each name with the lead guitarist's name. If a match is found, we return the corresponding birthday. This method is the most basic and does not require any advanced data structures, making it the least memory-intensive but the slowest among the strategies.\n"
