Given that the problem description is more about fetching a specific piece of information (a date) rather than processing a large dataset, a hash map is ideal for quick lookups. The core logic involves iterating through the list of band members and their corresponding birthdays, storing them in a hash map. When the lead guitarist's name is queried, we simply look up the value in the hash map. This approach ensures O(1) average time complexity for lookups. The space complexity is O(n), where n is the number of band members, due to the storage of the hash map.\n"

We iterate through the list of band members and compare each name with the lead guitarist's name. If a match is found, we return the corresponding birthday.
