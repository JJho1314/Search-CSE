For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: When is the lead guitarist of List Of The Dillinger Escape Plan Band Members's birthday?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  Instead of using a list, we can utilize a balanced binary search tree (BST) to store the band members' birthdays. The BST allows for efficient insertion and lookup operations, with a time complexity of O(log n) for both. The space complexity is O(n) for the tree structure. We insert each band member's name and birthday into the BST and then search for the lead guitarist's birthday. This strategy is particularly useful if we frequently need to add or remove band members from the list.\n",
