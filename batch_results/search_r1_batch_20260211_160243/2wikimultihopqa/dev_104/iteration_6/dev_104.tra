However, the search results did not provide the desired information. The agent then searched for the band members individually, which led to finding the lead guitarist's name as Mike Patton. The agent then searched for Mike Patton's birthday on Wikipedia, which correctly provided the answer March 24, 1964. Despite this, the answer was marked incorrect because the ground truth was 'August 8, 1975'.\n    search_queries:\n      - List Of The Dillinger Escape Plan Band Members\n      - List Of The Dillinger Escape Plan Band Members\n      - Mike Patton birthday\n    reasoning_quality: The reasoning was logical and followed a structured approach. However, the information provided in the search results did not match the expected answer, leading to a mismatch with the ground truth.\n    answer_quality: The final answer provided by the agent was correct in terms of the information retrieved, but the ground truth provided a different answer, indicating a mismatch.\n    key_learnings: Effective search strategies for this type of question involve breaking down the task into smaller, manageable parts (e.g., finding the lead guitarist first). The agent's approach was correct in terms of strategy but failed due to a mismatch between the retrieved information and the ground truth. Future improvements could involve verifying search results with secondary sources or ensuring the ground truth is accurately provided.\n  iteration: 4\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: March 24, 1964\n    ground_truth:\n      - August 8, 1975\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: False\n    subem_match: False\n    failure_reason: Answer 'March 24, 1964' does not match any of ['August 8, 1975']\n  source_entry_labels:\n\n  operator_name: plan\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\nRules:\n1. The answer in the previous attempt is WRONG \u2014 NEVER give that same answer again.\n2. The information that led to that wrong answer may also be wrong \u2014 do NOT trust it.\n3. Use DIFFERENT search queries than what was tried before. Search for each entity separately.\n4. Carefully check dates, names, and facts in the search results before concluding.\n5. Put your final answer inside <answer>...</answer> tags.\n"
