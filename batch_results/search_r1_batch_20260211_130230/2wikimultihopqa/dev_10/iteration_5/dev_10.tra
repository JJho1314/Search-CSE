Your task is to combine the best search strategies\nand reasoning from both attempts to produce a correct answer.\n\nAnalyze each trajectory to understand:\n- Which search queries found useful information and which did not\n- What relevant facts each attempt discovered\n- Where each attempt's reasoning went wrong\n- Whether either attempt was close to the correct answer\n\n### TRAJECTORY 1 SUMMARY\n  sol4\n  label: sol4\n  solution:\n  ```\n  ### STRATEGY MODE: REFLECTION AND REFINE STRATEGY\n  Your previous attempt at answering a factual question using search and reasoning did not produce\n  the correct answer.

Analyze why the previous attempt failed and fix it.\n\n  Common failure modes:\n  - **Wrong Search Queries**: The queries did not find the relevant information needed to answer the question.\n  - **Missed Key Information**: The search returned useful results but the agent failed to extract the critical fact.\n  - **Reasoning Error**: The agent found relevant information but drew an incorrect conclusion.\n  - **Format Error**: The agent knew the answer but did not format it correctly in <answer>...</answer> tags.\n  Identify which category applies, then focus your fix accordingly.\n\n  ### SOURCE TRAJECTORY SUMMARY\n    sol3\n    label: sol3\n    solution:\n    ```\n    <think>\n    I need to find out which film has the director who died first between \"Crimen A Las Tres\" and \"The Working Class Goes To Heaven\".\n    </think>\n    <search>director of Crimen A Las Tres, director of The Working Class Goes To Heaven</search>\n\n    ### Search Results:\n    - Crimen A Las Tres: Director is Jos\u00e9 Luis Borau (died on May 13, 2006)\n    - The Working Class Goes To Heaven: Director is John Waters (died on February 15, 2023)\n\n    <think>\n    I need to compare the death dates of the directors to find out who died first.\n    </think>\n    <search>death dates of Jos\u00e9 Luis Borau, John Waters</search>\n\n    ### Search Results:\n    - Jos\u00e9 Luis Borau: Died on May 13, 2006\n    - John Waters: Died on February 15, 2023\n\n    <think>\n    I need to find out which director died first to determine which film has the director who died first.\n    </think>\n    <search>earliest death date between Jos\u00e9 Luis Borau and John Waters</search>\n\n    ### Search Results:\n    - Jos\u00e9 Luis Borau: Died on May 13, 2006\n    - John Waters: Died on February 15, 2023\n\n    <think>\n    Since Jos\u00e9 Luis Borau died\n  ```\n  metric: 0.0\n  summary:\n    solution_name: multi_hop_v2\n    approach_summary: The agent employed a multi-hop strategy to gather information about the directors' death dates, comparing them to find the earliest death date.

Both directors died on the same date, but I need to find out which film has the director who died first.\n  2. Since both death dates are the same, I need to find out the release dates of the films to determine which director died first.\n  </think>\n  <search>release dates of Crimen A Las Tres and The Working Class Goes To Heaven</search>\n\n  ### Search Results:\n  - Crimen A Las Tres: Released on June 18, 2004\n  - The Working Class Goes To Heaven: Released on May 1, 2015\n\n  <think>\n  1. The film The Working Class Goes To Heaven was released later than Crimen A Las Tres.\n  2. Therefore, the director of Crimen A Las Tres, Alejandro Agresti, died first.\n  </think>\n  <answer>Crimen A Las Tres</answer>\n  ```\n  metric: 0.0\n  summary:\n    solution_name: multi_hop_v2\n    approach_summary: The agent initially searched for the directors of both films, then their death dates, and finally the release dates to determine which director died first. The reasoning was logical but missed the key point that both directors died on the same date, so the agent deduced the answer based on the release dates of the films.\n    search_queries:\n      - <search>directors of Crimen A Las Tres and The Working Class Goes To Heaven</search>\n      - <search>death date of Alejandro Agresti and Rodney Ascher</search>\n      - <search>release dates of Crimen A Las Tres and The Working Class Goes To Heaven</search>\n    reasoning_quality: Logical but missed the key point that both directors died on the same date\n    answer_quality: Correct\n    key_learnings: When searching for information, consider the possibility of multiple factors being equal and look for additional information to resolve these ties.\n  iteration: 2\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Crimen A Las Tres\n    ground_truth:\n      - La classe operaia va in paradiso\n      - The Working Class Goes To Heaven\n      - Working Class Goes to Heaven\n      - The Working Class Goes to Heaven\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: False\n    subem_match: False\n    failure_reason: Answer 'Crimen A Las Tres' does not match any of ['La classe operaia va in paradiso', 'The Working Class Goes To Heaven', 'Working Class Goes to Heaven', 'The Working Class Goes to Heaven']\n  source_entry_labels:\n\n  operator_name: plan\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\n### SYNTHESIS GUIDELINES\n1. **Combine Search Strategies**: Use the most effective search queries from both attempts. If T1 found relevant context about one aspect and T2 about another, combine both pieces of evidence.\n2. **Cross-validate Reasoning**: If both attempts reached different conclusions, use the search results from both to determine which reasoning chain is more supported by evidence.\n3. **Fill Knowledge Gaps**: If T1 missed a key fact that T2 found (or vice versa), ensure the combined approach uses all discovered information.\n4. **Avoid Shared Errors**: If both attempts made the same reasoning mistake, you MUST try a fundamentally different search approach or reasoning strategy for that part.\n5. **Produce Clean Answer**: The final answer should be a single, well-supported response inside <answer>...</answer> tags, backed by evidence from the combined search results.\n"
