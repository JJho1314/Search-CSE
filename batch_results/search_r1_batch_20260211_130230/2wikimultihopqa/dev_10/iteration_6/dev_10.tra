The reasoning was logical but missed the key point that both directors died on the same date, so the agent deduced the answer based on the release dates of the films.\n    search_queries:\n      - <search>directors of Crimen A Las Tres and The Working Class Goes To Heaven</search>\n      - <search>death date of Alejandro Agresti and Rodney Ascher</search>\n      - <search>release dates of Crimen A Las Tres and The Working Class Goes To Heaven</search>\n    reasoning_quality: Logical but missed the key point that both directors died on the same date\n    answer_quality: Correct\n    key_learnings: When searching for information, consider the possibility of multiple factors being equal and look for additional information to resolve these ties.\n  iteration: 2\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Crimen A Las Tres\n    ground_truth:\n      - La classe operaia va in paradiso\n      - The Working Class Goes To Heaven\n      - Working Class Goes to Heaven\n      - The Working Class Goes to Heaven\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: False\n    subem_match: False\n    failure_reason: Answer 'Crimen A Las Tres' does not match any of ['La classe operaia va in paradiso', 'The Working Class Goes To Heaven', 'Working Class Goes to Heaven', 'The Working Class Goes to Heaven']\n  source_entry_labels:\n\n  operator_name: plan\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\n### REFINEMENT GUIDELINES\n1. **Diagnose Search Quality**: Review the search queries used. Did they target the right entities and relationships? Were they too broad or too narrow? Try more specific or alternative phrasings.\n2. **Check Information Extraction**: Did the search results contain the answer? If yes, identify where the agent failed to notice or use it. If no, the queries need to be reformulated.\n3. **Fix Reasoning Chain**: Trace the logic from search results to the final answer. Look for incorrect assumptions, confusion between similar entities, or missing logical steps.\n4. **Verify Answer Format**: Ensure the answer is placed inside <answer>...</answer> tags and is concise (e.g., a name, date, or short phrase \u2014 not a full sentence).\n5. **Try Different Angles**: If direct search failed, try searching for related entities, events, or alternative formulations of the question.\n"
