The agent then used this information to determine which film had the director who died first.\n    search_queries:\n      - director of Crimen A Las Tres, director of The Working Class Goes To Heaven\n      - death dates of Jos\u00e9 Luis Borau, John Waters\n      - earliest death date between Jos\u00e9 Luis Borau and John Waters\n    reasoning_quality: Logical and effective reasoning chain, with clear steps to compare death dates and determine the correct film.\n    answer_quality: The final answer directly addresses the question, correctly identifying 'Crimen A Las Tres' as the film with the director who died first.\n    key_learnings: Effective use of multi-hop search and logical reasoning to find the correct answer. Highlighted the importance of comparing directly relevant information (death dates in this case) to solve the problem.\n  iteration: 3\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Crimen A Las Tres\n    ground_truth:\n      - La classe operaia va in paradiso\n      - The Working Class Goes To Heaven\n      - Working Class Goes to Heaven\n      - The Working Class Goes to Heaven\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: False\n    subem_match: False\n    failure_reason: Answer 'Crimen A Las Tres' does not match any of ['La classe operaia va in paradiso', 'The Working Class Goes To Heaven', 'Working Class Goes to Heaven', 'The Working Class Goes to Heaven']\n  source_entry_labels:\n\n  operator_name: plan\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\n### REFINEMENT GUIDELINES\n1. **Diagnose Search Quality**: Review the search queries used. Did they target the right entities and relationships? Were they too broad or too narrow? Try more specific or alternative phrasings.\n2. **Check Information Extraction**: Did the search results contain the answer? If yes, identify where the agent failed to notice or use it. If no, the queries need to be reformulated.\n3. **Fix Reasoning Chain**: Trace the logic from search results to the final answer. Look for incorrect assumptions, confusion between similar entities, or missing logical steps.\n4. **Verify Answer Format**: Ensure the answer is placed inside <answer>...</answer> tags and is concise (e.g., a name, date, or short phrase \u2014 not a full sentence).\n5. **Try Different Angles**: If direct search failed, try searching for related entities, events, or alternative formulations of the question.\n"
