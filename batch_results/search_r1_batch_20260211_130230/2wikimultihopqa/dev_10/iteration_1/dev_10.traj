The algorithm performs a BFS or DFS from each film to find the shortest path to the director's death. The film with the shortest path is the one where the director died first. This strategy has a Time Complexity of O(V + E), where V is the number of films and E is the number of edges (directors). Space Complexity: O(V + E).\n",
