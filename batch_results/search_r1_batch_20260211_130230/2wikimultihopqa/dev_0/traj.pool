They first searched for the director and found Wojciech Kilar, who has no known mother. Then, they searched for more information about the film and found that the director is Xawery Żuławski. They realized that they needed to find the mother of Żuławski, so they searched for more information about him and found that his mother is Małgorzata Braunek.\n    search_queries:\n      - Who is the director of the film Polish-Russian War (Film)?\n      - Who is the mother of Wojciech Kilar?\n      - Who is the director of the film Polish-Russian War (Film)?\n      - Who is the mother of Wojciech Kilar?\n      - Who directed the film Polish-Russian War (Film) and what is the mother of the director?\n    reasoning_quality: The reasoning chain was logical and well-structured. The agent effectively used the search results to guide their next steps and eventually found the correct answer.\n    answer_quality: The answer directly addresses the question and is correct.\n    key_learnings: Effective search strategies for this type of question include using multiple search queries to gather information and connecting the information found to the original question. It's also important to recognize when additional information is needed and to conduct a new search accordingly.\n  iteration: 1\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: null\n    ground_truth:\n      - Małgorzata Braunek\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    failure_reason: No <answer>...</answer> tag found\n  source_entry_labels:\n\n  operator_name: plan\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\n### SYNTHESIS GUIDELINES\n1. **Combine Search Strategies**: Use the most effective search queries from both attempts. If T1 found relevant context about one aspect and T2 about another, combine both pieces of evidence.\n2. **Cross-validate Reasoning**: If both attempts reached different conclusions, use the search results from both to determine which reasoning chain is more supported by evidence.\n3. **Fill Knowledge Gaps**: If T1 missed a key fact that T2 found (or vice versa), ensure the combined approach uses all discovered information.\n4. **Avoid Shared Errors**: If both attempts made the same reasoning mistake, you MUST try a fundamentally different search approach or reasoning strategy for that part.\n5. **Produce Clean Answer**: The final answer should be a single, well-supported response inside <answer>...</answer> tags, backed by evidence from the combined search results.\n"

If T1 found relevant context about one aspect and T2 about another, combine both pieces of evidence.\n2. **Cross-validate Reasoning**: If both attempts reached different conclusions, use the search results from both to determine which reasoning chain is more supported by evidence.\n3. **Fill Knowledge Gaps**: If T1 missed a key fact that T2 found (or vice versa), ensure the combined approach uses all discovered information.\n4. **Avoid Shared Errors**: If both attempts made the same reasoning mistake, you MUST try a fundamentally different search approach or reasoning strategy for that part.\n5. **Produce Clean Answer**: The final answer should be a single, well-supported response inside <answer>...</answer> tags, backed by evidence from the combined search results.\n"
