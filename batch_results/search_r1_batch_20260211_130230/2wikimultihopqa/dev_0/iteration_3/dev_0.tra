After reasoning, if you find you lack some knowledge, you can call a search engine by <search> query </search> and it will return the top searched results between <information> and </information>. You can search as many times as you want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Who is the mother of the director of film Polish-Russian War (Film)?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  A binary search approach can be used to solve this problem by maintaining a sorted list of films and their directors. The core logic involves performing a binary search on the list to find the film with the given director. Once the film is found, the mother of the director can be found by looking up the previous film in the list. The time complexity of this approach is O(log n) and the space complexity is O(n), where n is the number of films.\n"
