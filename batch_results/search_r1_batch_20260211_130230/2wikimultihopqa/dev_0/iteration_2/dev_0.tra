After reasoning, if you find you lack some knowledge, you can call a search engine by <search> query </search> and it will return the top searched results between <information> and </information>. You can search as many times as you want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Who is the mother of the director of film Polish-Russian War (Film)?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  A greedy algorithm can be used to solve this problem by always choosing the most recent film as the mother of the director. The core logic involves keeping track of the most recent film and its director. When a new film with a director is encountered, the mother of the director is set to the director of the most recent film. The time complexity of this approach is O(n) and the space complexity is O(1), where n is the number of films.\n"
