After identifying the directors, the agent searched for their mothers but found no information. The agent concluded with an answer of 'None', which was incorrect based on the ground truth.\n    search_queries:\n      - <search>director of Polish-Russian War</search>\n      - <search>mother of director of Polish-Russian War</search>\n    reasoning_quality: Logical but missed the key information about the mother of the director. The agent correctly identified the directors but failed to recognize the importance of the 'mother' part of the question.\n    answer_quality: Incorrect\n    key_learnings: The agent should focus on the specific details required by the question (in this case, the mother's name) and ensure that the search queries are directed towards finding that specific information.\n  iteration: 2\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: None\n    ground_truth:\n      - Ma\u0142gorzata Braunek\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: False\n    subem_match: False\n    failure_reason: Answer 'None' does not match any of ['Ma\u0142gorzata Braunek']\n  source_entry_labels:\n\n  operator_name: plan\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\n### SYNTHESIS GUIDELINES\n1. **Combine Search Strategies**: Use the most effective search queries from both attempts. If T1 found relevant context about one aspect and T2 about another, combine both pieces of evidence.\n2. **Cross-validate Reasoning**: If both attempts reached different conclusions, use the search results from both to determine which reasoning chain is more supported by evidence.\n3. **Fill Knowledge Gaps**: If T1 missed a key fact that T2 found (or vice versa), ensure the combined approach uses all discovered information.\n4. **Avoid Shared Errors**: If both attempts made the same reasoning mistake, you MUST try a fundamentally different search approach or reasoning strategy for that part.\n5. **Produce Clean Answer**: The final answer should be a single, well-supported response inside <answer>...</answer> tags, backed by evidence from the combined search results.\n"
