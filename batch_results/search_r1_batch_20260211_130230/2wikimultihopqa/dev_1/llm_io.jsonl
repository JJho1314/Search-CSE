If T1 found relevant context about one aspect and T2 about another, combine both pieces of evidence.\\n2. **Cross-validate Reasoning**: If both attempts reached different conclusions, use the search results from both to determine which reasoning chain is more supported by evidence.\\n3. **Fill Knowledge Gaps**: If T1 missed a key fact that T2 found (or vice versa), ensure the combined approach uses all discovered information.\\n4. **Avoid Shared Errors**: If both attempts made the same reasoning mistake, you MUST try a fundamentally different search approach or reasoning strategy for that part.\\n5. **Produce Clean Answer**: The final answer should be a single, well-supported response inside <answer>...</answer> tags, backed by evidence from the combined search results.\\n\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"## Previous Attempt Result\\n\\n- Status: \\u274c Incorrect\\n- Extracted answer: None\\n\\n## Your Previous Reasoning Trajectory\\n\\n\\n\\n## Instructions\\nYour previous answer was incorrect.
