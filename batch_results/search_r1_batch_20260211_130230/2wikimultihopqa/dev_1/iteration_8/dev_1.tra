However, the agent concluded that both films were released simultaneously, leading to an incorrect answer.\n    search_queries:\n      - which film came out first, Blind Shaft or The Mask Of Fu Manchu\n      - release dates of Blind Shaft and The Mask Of Fu Manchu\n    reasoning_quality: The reasoning chain was logical, but missed the connection that both films were released in the same year, leading to the incorrect conclusion that they were released simultaneously.\n    answer_quality: The final answer was incorrect, as it did not directly address the question of which film came out first.\n    key_learnings: When searching for release dates of films, it is important to consider that both films may have been released in the same year, and additional information may be needed to determine which film came out first.\n  iteration: 4\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Blind Shaft\n    ground_truth:\n      - The Mask Of Fu Manchu\n      - Mask of Fu Manchu\n      - The Mask of Fu Manchu\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: False\n    subem_match: False\n    failure_reason: Answer 'Blind Shaft' does not match any of ['The Mask Of Fu Manchu', 'Mask of Fu Manchu', 'The Mask of Fu Manchu']\n  source_entry_labels:\n    - sol3\n  operator_name: reflection_refine\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\n### REFINEMENT GUIDELINES\n1. **Diagnose Search Quality**: Review the search queries used. Did they target the right entities and relationships? Were they too broad or too narrow? Try more specific or alternative phrasings.\n2. **Check Information Extraction**: Did the search results contain the answer? If yes, identify where the agent failed to notice or use it. If no, the queries need to be reformulated.\n3. **Fix Reasoning Chain**: Trace the logic from search results to the final answer. Look for incorrect assumptions, confusion between similar entities, or missing logical steps.\n4. **Verify Answer Format**: Ensure the answer is placed inside <answer>...</answer> tags and is concise (e.g., a name, date, or short phrase \u2014 not a full sentence).\n5. **Try Different Angles**: If direct search failed, try searching for related entities, events, or alternative formulations of the question.\n"
