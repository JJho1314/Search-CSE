You can search as many times as you want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Who is the father of the director of film Gramps Is In The Resistance?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  Create a LinkedList to store the father's names, ordered chronologically. For each director named 'Gramps Is In The Resistance', append the father's name to the end of the LinkedList. This strategy uses LinkedList to maintain a linked list of father names, allowing for efficient insertion at the end. The expected Time Complexity for insertion is O(1), and the Space Complexity is O(n), where n is the number of father names in the LinkedList.\n"
