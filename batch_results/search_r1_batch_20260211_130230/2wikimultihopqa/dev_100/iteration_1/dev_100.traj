For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Who is the father of the director of film Gramps Is In The Resistance?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  Utilize a TreeSet to store the unique first names of fathers of directors. Add the father's name for each director named 'Gramps Is In The Resistance'. This strategy employs TreeSet to maintain the names in a sorted manner, ensuring uniqueness and efficient searching. The expected Time Complexity for insertion and searching in TreeSet is O(log n), and the Space Complexity is O(n), where n is the number of unique father names.\n",
