After reasoning, if you find you lack some knowledge, you can call a search engine by <search> query </search> and it will return the top searched results between <information> and </information>. You can search as many times as you want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Who is the father of the director of film Gramps Is In The Resistance?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  Implement a HashMap where the key is the director's name and the value is the father's name. For each director named 'Gramps Is In The Resistance', retrieve the corresponding father's name from the HashMap. This strategy uses HashMap for quick lookups and insertions, resulting in an expected Time Complexity of O(1) for both operations, and a Space Complexity of O(n), where n is the number of entries in the HashMap.\n"
