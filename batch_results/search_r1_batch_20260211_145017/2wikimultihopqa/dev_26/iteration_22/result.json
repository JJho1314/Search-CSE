Now I need to compare the death dates: Richard Wallace died on March 15, 1948, and Joshua Marston died on January 14, 2018. Since 1948 is earlier than 2018, the director who died earlier is Richard Wallace, and thus the film \"Condemned Women\" is the correct answer.\n</think>\n<answer>\nCondemned Women\n</answer>",
