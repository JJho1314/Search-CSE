The agent then compared these dates to determine which director died earlier and which film that director was associated with. Despite multiple iterations and previous incorrect answers, the agent correctly identified the need to search for the death dates of both directors and compared them to form a logical conclusion.\n    search_queries:\n      - director of Condemned Women and their death date\n      - director of Faces In The Dark and their death date\n    reasoning_quality: Logical and effective. The agent correctly identified the need to find the death dates of both directors and then compared them to determine the answer. However, the agent missed verifying the accuracy of the previous searches, leading to incorrect conclusions in the past. This time, the agent correctly reasoned through the data and reached the right conclusion.\n    answer_quality: 1.0\n    key_learnings:\n      - The direct search approach is effective for solving factual questions that require discrete information.\n      - It is crucial to verify the accuracy of the information found in previous searches before drawing conclusions.\n      - Logical reasoning and comparison of facts are essential in solving such questions.\n  iteration: 9\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Condemned Women\n    ground_truth:\n      - Condemned Women\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: True\n    subem_match: True\n  source_entry_labels:\n    - iter1_sol8\n    - iter1_sol4\n  operator_name: crossover\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\nRules:\n1. The answer in the previous attempt is WRONG — NEVER give that same answer again.\n2. The information that led to that wrong answer may also be wrong — do NOT trust it.\n3. Use DIFFERENT search queries than what was tried before. Search for each entity separately.\n4. Carefully check dates, names, and facts in the search results before concluding.\n5.
