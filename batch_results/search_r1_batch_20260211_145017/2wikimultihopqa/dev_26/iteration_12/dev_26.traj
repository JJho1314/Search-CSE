After obtaining the necessary information, the agent compared the death dates and provided the correct answer.\n    search_queries:\n      - <search>director of Condemned Women and death date</search>\n      - <search>director of Faces In The Dark and death date</search>\n    reasoning_quality: Logical and effective. The agent correctly identified the need to find the death dates of both directors and then compared them to determine the answer.\n    answer_quality: Correct. The final answer 'Condemned Women' directly addresses the question and is the correct response based on the information found.\n    key_learnings:\n      - Directly searching for the necessary information is an effective strategy when the question can be answered with discrete facts.\n      - Compiling and comparing multiple data points (in this case, death dates) is a crucial step in solving the problem.\n      - Clear and structured reasoning inside  helps in organizing the search and analysis process.\n  iteration: 4\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Condemned Women\n    ground_truth:\n      - Condemned Women\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: True\n    subem_match: True\n  source_entry_labels:\n\n  operator_name: plan\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\nRules:\n1. The answer in the previous attempt is WRONG — NEVER give that same answer again.\n2. The information that led to that wrong answer may also be wrong — do NOT trust it.\n3. Use DIFFERENT search queries than what was tried before. Search for each entity separately.\n4. Carefully check dates, names, and facts in the search results before concluding.\n5.
