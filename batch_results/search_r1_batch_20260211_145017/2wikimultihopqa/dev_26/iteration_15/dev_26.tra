For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Which film has the director died earlier, Condemned Women or Faces In The Dark?\n\nIMPORTANT: Two previous attempts are shown below. BOTH gave WRONG answers.\nYou MUST NOT repeat either wrong answer. Both answers shown below are INCORRECT.\nUse any useful search results from both attempts, but reach a DIFFERENT conclusion.\n\n### TRAJECTORY 1 SUMMARY\n  iter1_sol14\n  label: iter1_sol14\n  solution:\n  ```\n  <think>\n  The question asks which film has the director who died earlier between \"Condemned Women\" and \"Faces In The Dark\". I need to find the death years of the directors for both films and compare them. Let's start by finding the director's name and death date for \"Condemned Women\".\n  </think>\n  <search>director of Condemned Women and death date</search>\n  <information>\n  - Condemned Women (1945) was directed by Richard Wallace\n  - Richard Wallace died in 1948\n  </information>\n  <think>\n  Now I have the death date of the director of \"Condemned Women\". Next, I need to find the death date of the director of \"Faces In The Dark\".\n  </think>\n  <search>director of Faces In The Dark and death date</search>\n  <information>\n  - Faces In The Dark (2014) was directed by Joshua Marston\n  - Joshua Marston died in 2018\n  </information>\n  <think>\n  Now I have the death dates of both directors:\n  - Richard Wallace (Condemned Women) died in 1948\n  - Joshua Marston (Faces In The Dark) died in 2018\n\n  Since 1948 is earlier than 2018, the film with the director who died earlier is \"Condemned Women\".\n  </think>\n  <answer>\n  Condemned Women\n  </answer>\n  ```\n  metric: 1.0\n  summary:\n    solution_name: direct_search\n    approach_summary: The agent employed a straightforward approach by directly searching for the director's names and death dates of both films. After obtaining the necessary information, the agent compared the death dates to determine the correct answer.\n    search_queries:\n      - <search>director of Condemned Women and death date</search>\n      - <search>director of Faces In The Dark and death date</search>\n    reasoning_quality: Logical and effective. The agent correctly identified the need to find the death dates of both directors and then compared them to determine the answer.\n    answer_quality: Correct. The final answer 'Condemned Women' directly addresses the question and is the correct response based on the information found.\n    key_learnings: Directly searching for the necessary information is an effective strategy when the question can be answered with discrete facts. Compiling and comparing multiple data points (in this case, death dates) is a crucial step in solving the problem. Clear and structured reasoning inside  helps in organizing the search and analysis process.\n  iteration: 14\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Condemned Women\n    ground_truth:\n      - Condemned Women\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: True\n    subem_match: True\n  source_entry_labels:\n    - iter1_sol4\n  operator_name: reflection_refine\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\n### TRAJECTORY 2 SUMMARY\n  iter1_sol6\n  label: iter1_sol6\n  solution:\n  ```\n  <think>\n  The question asks which of the two films, \"Condemned Women\" or \"Faces In The Dark\", has the director who died earlier.
