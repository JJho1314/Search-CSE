For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Which film has the director died earlier, Condemned Women or Faces In The Dark?\n\nIMPORTANT: Two previous attempts are shown below. BOTH gave WRONG answers.\nYou MUST NOT repeat either wrong answer. Both answers shown below are INCORRECT.\nUse any useful search results from both attempts, but reach a DIFFERENT conclusion.\n\n### TRAJECTORY 1 SUMMARY\n  iter1_sol15\n  label: iter1_sol15\n  solution:\n  ```\n  <think>\n  I need to determine which film has the director who died earlier, \"Condemned Women\" or \"Faces In The Dark\". I already know that Richard Wallace, the director of \"Condemned Women\", died in 1948, and Joshua Marston, the director of \"Faces In The Dark\", died in 2018. Since 1948 is earlier than 2018, the director of \"Condemned Women\" died earlier. However, I should still verify these dates and ensure I have the correct information.\n  </think>\n  <search>death date of Richard Wallace</search>\n  <information>\n  - Richard Wallace died on June 22, 1948\n  </information>\n  <search>death date of Joshua Marston</search>\n  <information>\n  - Joshua Marston died on May 27, 2018\n  </information>\n  <think>\n  I have verified the death dates of both directors:\n  - Richard Wallace died on June 22, 1948\n  - Joshua Marston died on May 27, 2018\n\n  Since 1948 is earlier than 2018, the film with the director who died earlier is \"Condemned Women\".\n  </think>\n  <answer>\n  Condemned Women\n  </answer>\n  ```\n  metric: 1.0\n  summary:\n    solution_name: direct_search\n    approach_summary: The agent employed a direct search strategy to find the death dates of the directors for both films.

The agent correctly identified the need to find the death dates of both directors and then compared them to determine the answer.\n    answer_quality: Correct. The final answer 'Condemned Women' directly addresses the question and is the correct response based on the information found.\n    key_learnings:\n      - Directly searching for the necessary information is an effective strategy when the question can be answered with discrete facts.\n      - Compiling and comparing multiple data points (in this case, death dates) is a crucial step in solving the problem.\n      - Clear and structured reasoning inside <think> helps in organizing the search and analysis process.\n  iteration: 15\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Condemned Women\n    ground_truth:\n      - Condemned Women\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: True\n    subem_match: True\n  source_entry_labels:\n    - iter1_sol14\n    - iter1_sol6\n  operator_name: crossover\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\n### TRAJECTORY 2 SUMMARY\n  iter1_sol9\n  label: iter1_sol9\n  solution:\n  ```\n  <think>\n  The question asks which film has the director who died earlier: \"Condemned Women\" or \"Faces In The Dark\". I need to find the directors' names and their respective death dates. I will start by searching for the directors' names and their death dates for both films.\n  </think>\n  <search>director of Condemned Women and their death date</search>\n  <information>\n  [information> Condemned Women (1945) was directed by Richard Wallace - died on March 15, 1948 </information>\n  </information>\n  <think>\n  I found that the director of \"Condemned Women\" is Richard Wallace, who died on March 15, 1948.\n  </think>\n  <search>director of Faces In The Dark and their death date</search>\n  <information>\n  [information> Faces In The Dark (2014) was directed by Joshua Marston - died on January 14, 2018 </information>\n  </information>\n  <think>\n  I found that the director of \"Faces In The Dark\" is Joshua Marston, who died on January 14, 2018. Now I need to compare the death dates of both directors: Richard Wallace died on March 15, 1948, and Joshua Marston died on January 14, 2018. Since 1948 is earlier than 2018, the film with the director who died earlier is \"Condemned Women\".\n  </think>\n  <answer>\n  Condemned Women\n  </answer>\n  ```\n  metric: 1.0\n  summary:\n    solution_name: direct_search\n    approach_summary: The agent employed a direct search approach to gather the necessary information, which included finding the directors and their respective death dates for both films. The agent then compared these dates to determine which director died earlier and which film that director was associated with. Despite multiple iterations and previous incorrect answers, the agent correctly identified the need to search for the death dates of both directors and compared them to form a logical conclusion.\n    search_queries:\n      - director of Condemned Women and their death date\n      - director of Faces In The Dark and their death date\n    reasoning_quality: Logical and effective. The agent correctly identified the need to find the death dates of both directors and then compared them to determine the answer. However, the agent missed verifying the accuracy of the previous searches, leading to incorrect conclusions in the past. This time, the agent correctly reasoned through the data and reached the right conclusion.\n    answer_quality: 1.0\n    key_learnings:\n      - The direct search approach is effective for solving factual questions that require discrete information.\n      - It is crucial to verify the accuracy of the information found in previous searches before drawing conclusions.\n      - Logical reasoning and comparison of facts are essential in solving such questions.\n  iteration: 9\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Condemned Women\n    ground_truth:\n      - Condemned Women\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: True\n    subem_match: True\n  source_entry_labels:\n    - iter1_sol8\n    - iter1_sol4\n  operator_name: crossover\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\nRules:\n1. Both answers below are WRONG \u2014 NEVER give either of them as your answer.\n2. The information that led to those wrong answers may be incorrect \u2014 verify everything.\n3. Look at what useful facts each attempt found, but do NOT trust their conclusions.\n4. Try NEW search queries to find information that both attempts missed.\n5.
