I already know the directors and their years of death:\n- \"Condemned Women\" was directed by Richard Wallace, who died in 1948.\n- \"Faces In The Dark\" was directed by Joshua Marston, who died in 2018.\n\nSince both attempts correctly identified these facts, the mistake must be in comparing these dates. Let's recheck the dates:\n- Richard Wallace: 1948\n- Joshua Marston: 2018\n\nClearly, 1948 is earlier than 2018. Therefore, Richard Wallace, the director of \"Condemned Women\", died earlier. So, \"Condemned Women\" should be the correct answer.\n</think>\n<search>death year of Richard Wallace and Joshua Marston</search>\n<information>\n- Richard Wallace died in 1948\n- Joshua Marston died in 2018\n</information>\n<think>\nI have confirmed the death years of the directors. Richard Wallace died in 1948 and Joshua Marston died in 2018. Since 1948 is earlier, the film with the director who died earlier is \"Condemned Women\".\n</think>\n<answer>\nCondemned Women\n</answer>",
