Both answers shown below are INCORRECT.\nUse any useful search results from both attempts, but reach a DIFFERENT conclusion.\n\n### TRAJECTORY 1 SUMMARY\n  iter1_sol9\n  label: iter1_sol9\n  solution:\n  ```\n  <think>\n  The question asks which film has the director who died earlier: \"Condemned Women\" or \"Faces In The Dark\". I need to find the directors' names and their respective death dates. I will start by searching for the directors' names and their death dates for both films.\n  </think>\n  <search>director of Condemned Women and their death date</search>\n  <information>\n  [information> Condemned Women (1945) was directed by Richard Wallace - died on March 15, 1948 </information>\n  </information>\n  <think>\n  I found that the director of \"Condemned Women\" is Richard Wallace, who died on March 15, 1948.\n  </think>\n  <search>director of Faces In The Dark and their death date</search>\n  <information>\n  [information> Faces In The Dark (2014) was directed by Joshua Marston - died on January 14, 2018 </information>\n  </information>\n  <think>\n  I found that the director of \"Faces In The Dark\" is Joshua Marston, who died on January 14, 2018. Now I need to compare the death dates of both directors: Richard Wallace died on March 15, 1948, and Joshua Marston died on January 14, 2018. Since 1948 is earlier than 2018, the film with the director who died earlier is \"Condemned Women\".\n  </think>\n  <answer>\n  Condemned Women\n  </answer>\n  ```\n  metric: 1.0\n  summary:\n    solution_name: direct_search\n    approach_summary: The agent employed a direct search approach to gather the necessary information, which included finding the directors and their respective death dates for both films. The agent then compared these dates to determine which director died earlier and which film that director was associated with. Despite multiple iterations and previous incorrect answers, the agent correctly identified the need to search for the death dates of both directors and compared them to form a logical conclusion.\n    search_queries:\n      - director of Condemned Women and their death date\n      - director of Faces In The Dark and their death date\n    reasoning_quality: Logical and effective. The agent correctly identified the need to find the death dates of both directors and then compared them to determine the answer. However, the agent missed verifying the accuracy of the previous searches, leading to incorrect conclusions in the past. This time, the agent correctly reasoned through the data and reached the right conclusion.\n    answer_quality: 1.0\n    key_learnings:\n      - The direct search approach is effective for solving factual questions that require discrete information.\n      - It is crucial to verify the accuracy of the information found in previous searches before drawing conclusions.\n      - Logical reasoning and comparison of facts are essential in solving such questions.\n  iteration: 9\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Condemned Women\n    ground_truth:\n      - Condemned Women\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: True\n    subem_match: True\n  source_entry_labels:\n    - iter1_sol8\n    - iter1_sol4\n  operator_name: crossover\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\n### TRAJECTORY 2 SUMMARY\n  iter2_sol4\n  label: iter2_sol4\n  solution:\n  ```\n  <think>\n  The question is to determine which film has the director who died earlier between \"Condemned Women\" and \"Faces In The Dark\". I already know the directors and their years of death:\n  - \"Condemned Women\" was directed by Richard Wallace, who died in 1948.\n  - \"Faces In The Dark\" was directed by Joshua Marston, who died in 2018.\n\n  Since both attempts correctly identified these facts, the mistake must be in comparing these dates. Let's recheck the dates:\n  - Richard Wallace: 1948\n  - Joshua Marston: 2018\n\n  Clearly, 1948 is earlier than 2018. Therefore, Richard Wallace, the director of \"Condemned Women\", died earlier. So, \"Condemned Women\" should be the correct answer.\n  </think>\n  <search>death year of Richard Wallace and Joshua Marston</search>\n  <information>\n  - Richard Wallace died in 1948\n  - Joshua Marston died in 2018\n  </information>\n  <think>\n  I have confirmed the death years of the directors. Richard Wallace died in 1948 and Joshua Marston died in 2018. Since 1948 is earlier, the film with the director who died earlier is \"Condemned Women\".\n  </think>\n  <answer>\n  Condemned Women\n  </answer>\n  ```\n  metric: 1.0\n  summary:\n    solution_name: direct_search\n    approach_summary: The agent used a direct search approach to find the death dates of the directors for both films. After obtaining the necessary information, the agent compared the death dates to determine the correct answer. Despite the repetitive nature of the queries, the agent managed to find the correct answer by confirming the death dates again.\n    search_queries:\n      - <search>death year of Richard Wallace and Joshua Marston</search>\n    reasoning_quality: Logical and effective. The agent correctly identified the need to find and compare the death dates of both directors to determine the answer.\n    answer_quality: Correct. The final answer 'Condemned Women' directly addresses the question and is the correct response based on the information found.\n    key_learnings:\n      - Directly searching for the necessary information is an effective strategy when the question can be answered with discrete facts.\n      - Compiling and comparing multiple data points (in this case, death dates) is a crucial step in solving the problem.\n      - Clear and structured reasoning inside <think> helps in organizing the search and analysis process.\n      - The agent effectively learned from previous incorrect attempts by rechecking the dates and providing a correct answer.\n  iteration: 19\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Condemned Women\n    ground_truth:\n      - Condemned Women\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: True\n    subem_match: True\n  source_entry_labels:\n    - iter1_sol12\n    - iter1_sol14\n  operator_name: crossover\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\nRules:\n1.
