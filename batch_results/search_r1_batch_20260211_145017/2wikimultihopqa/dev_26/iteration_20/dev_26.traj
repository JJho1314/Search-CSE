      "content": "Answer the given question. You must conduct reasoning inside <think> and </think> first every time you get new information. After reasoning, if you find you lack some knowledge, you can call a search engine by <search> query </search> and it will return the top searched results between <information> and </information>. You can search as many times as you want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Which film has the director died earlier, Condemned Women or Faces In The Dark?\n\nIMPORTANT: Your previous attempt gave a WRONG answer. The previous attempt is shown below.\nYou MUST NOT repeat the same wrong answer. The answer shown below is INCORRECT.\nTry completely different search queries and reasoning to find the correct answer.\n\n### SOURCE TRAJECTORY SUMMARY\n  iter1_sol15\n  label: iter1_sol15\n  solution:\n  ```\n  <think>\n  I need to determine which film has the director who died earlier, \"Condemned Women\" or \"Faces In The Dark\". I already know that Richard Wallace, the director of \"Condemned Women\", died in 1948, and Joshua Marston, the director of \"Faces In The Dark\", died in 2018. Since 1948 is earlier than 2018, the director of \"Condemned Women\" died earlier. However, I should still verify these dates and ensure I have the correct information.\n  </think>\n  <search>death date of Richard Wallace</search>\n  <information>\n  - Richard Wallace died on June 22, 1948\n  </information>\n  <search>death date of Joshua Marston</search>\n  <information>\n  - Joshua Marston died on May 27, 2018\n  </information>\n  <think>\n  I have verified the death dates of both directors:\n  - Richard Wallace died on June 22, 1948\n  - Joshua Marston died on May 27, 2018\n\n  Since 1948 is earlier than 2018, the film with the director who died earlier is \"Condemned Women\".\n  </think>\n  <answer>\n  Condemned Women\n  </answer>\n  ```\n  metric: 1.0\n  summary:\n    solution_name: direct_search\n    approach_summary: The agent employed a direct search strategy to find the death dates of the directors for both films. After obtaining the necessary information, the agent compared the death dates to determine the correct answer.\n    search_queries:\n      - <search>death date of Richard Wallace</search>\n      - <search>death date of Joshua Marston</search>\n    reasoning_quality: Logical and effective. The agent correctly identified the need to find the death dates of both directors and then compared them to determine the answer.\n    answer_quality: Correct. The final answer 'Condemned Women' directly addresses the question and is the correct response based on the information found.\n    key_learnings:\n      - Directly searching for the necessary information is an effective strategy when the question can be answered with discrete facts.\n      - Compiling and comparing multiple data points (in this case, death dates) is a crucial step in solving the problem.\n      - Clear and structured reasoning inside <think> helps in organizing the search and analysis process.\n  iteration: 15\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Condemned Women\n    ground_truth:\n      - Condemned Women\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: True\n    subem_match: True\n  source_entry_labels:\n    - iter1_sol14\n    - iter1_sol6\n  operator_name: crossover\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\nRules:\n1. The answer in the previous attempt is WRONG — NEVER give that same answer again.\n2. The information that led to that wrong answer may also be wrong — do NOT trust it.\n3. Use DIFFERENT search queries than what was tried before. Search for each entity separately.\n4. Carefully check dates, names, and facts in the search results before concluding.\n5. Put your final answer inside <answer>...</answer> tags.\n",
