Now I need to compare the death dates of both directors: Richard Wallace died on March 15, 1948, and Joshua Marston died on January 14, 2018. Since 1948 is earlier than 2018, the film with the director who died earlier is \"Condemned Women\".\n  </think>\n  <answer>\n  Condemned Women\n  </answer>\n  ```\n  metric: 1.0\n  summary:\n    solution_name: direct_search\n    approach_summary: The agent employed a direct search approach to gather the necessary information, which included finding the directors and their respective death dates for both films.

I already know the directors and their years of death:\n  - \"Condemned Women\" was directed by Richard Wallace, who died in 1948.\n  - \"Faces In The Dark\" was directed by Joshua Marston, who died in 2018.\n\n  Since both attempts correctly identified these facts, the mistake must be in comparing these dates. Let's recheck the dates:\n  - Richard Wallace: 1948\n  - Joshua Marston: 2018\n\n  Clearly, 1948 is earlier than 2018. Therefore, Richard Wallace, the director of \"Condemned Women\", died earlier. So, \"Condemned Women\" should be the correct answer.\n  </think>\n  <search>death year of Richard Wallace and Joshua Marston</search>\n  <information>\n  - Richard Wallace died in 1948\n  - Joshua Marston died in 2018\n  </information>\n  <think>\n  I have confirmed the death years of the directors. Richard Wallace died in 1948 and Joshua Marston died in 2018. Since 1948 is earlier, the film with the director who died earlier is \"Condemned Women\".\n  </think>\n  <answer>\n  Condemned Women\n  </answer>\n  ```\n  metric: 1.0\n  summary:\n    solution_name: direct_search\n    approach_summary: The agent used a direct search approach to find the death dates of the directors for both films.

The final answer 'Condemned Women' directly addresses the question and is the correct response based on the information found.\n    key_learnings:\n      - Directly searching for the necessary information is an effective strategy when the question can be answered with discrete facts.\n      - Compiling and comparing multiple data points (in this case, death dates) is a crucial step in solving the problem.\n      - Clear and structured reasoning inside <think> helps in organizing the search and analysis process.\n      - The agent effectively learned from previous incorrect attempts by rechecking the dates and providing a correct answer.\n  iteration: 19\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Condemned Women\n    ground_truth:\n      - Condemned Women\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: True\n    subem_match: True\n  source_entry_labels:\n    - iter1_sol12\n    - iter1_sol14\n  operator_name: crossover\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\nRules:\n1.
