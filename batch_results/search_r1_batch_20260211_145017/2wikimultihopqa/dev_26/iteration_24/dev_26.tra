After reasoning, if you find you lack some knowledge, you can call a search engine by <search> query </search> and it will return the top searched results between <information> and </information>. You can search as many times as you want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Which film has the director died earlier, Condemned Women or Faces In The Dark?\n\nIMPORTANT: Your previous attempt gave a WRONG answer. The previous attempt is shown below.\nYou MUST NOT repeat the same wrong answer. The answer shown below is INCORRECT.\nTry completely different search queries and reasoning to find the correct answer.\n\n### SOURCE TRAJECTORY SUMMARY\n  iter1_sol7\n  label: iter1_sol7\n  solution:\n  ```\n  <think>\n  The question is about which film has the director who died earlier: \"Condemned Women\" or \"Faces In The Dark\". I already know the directors and their death dates from previous searches:\n  - Richard Wallace (director of \"Condemned Women\") died in 1948\n  - Joshua Marston (director of \"Faces In The Dark\") died in 2018\n\n  Since the death date doesn't change, Richard Wallace died earlier than Joshua Marston. Therefore, the director who died earlier is for the film \"Condemned Women\".\n  </think>\n  <search>death year of Richard Wallace and Joshua Marston comparison</search>\n  <information>\n  - Richard Wallace died in 1948\n  - Joshua Marston died in 2018\n  </information>\n  <think>\n  The information confirms my previous conclusion. Richard Wallace died in 1948, which is earlier than Joshua Marston's death in 2018.\n  </think>\n  <answer>\n  Condemned Women\n  </answer>\n  ```\n  metric: 1.0\n  summary:\n    solution_name: direct_search\n    approach_summary: The agent followed a direct search approach by retrieving the death dates of the directors for both films and then comparing them to determine which director died earlier. The answer was derived logically from the information gathered in previous iterations.\n    search_queries:\n      - <search>death year of Richard Wallace and Joshua Marston comparison</search>\n    reasoning_quality: Logical and consistent. The agent used the information from previous searches and directly compared the death dates to reach the conclusion.\n    answer_quality: Correct. The final answer 'Condemned Women' directly addresses the question and is correct based on the information found.\n    key_learnings:\n      - Directly searching for the necessary information is an effective strategy when the question can be answered with discrete facts.\n      - Compiling and comparing multiple data points (in this case, death dates) is crucial in solving the problem.\n      - Clear and structured reasoning inside <think> helps in organizing the search and analysis process.\n  iteration: 7\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Condemned Women\n    ground_truth:\n      - Condemned Women\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: True\n    subem_match: True\n  source_entry_labels:\n    - iter1_sol6\n    - iter1_sol4\n  operator_name: crossover\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\nRules:\n1. The answer in the previous attempt is WRONG \u2014 NEVER give that same answer again.\n2. The information that led to that wrong answer may also be wrong \u2014 do NOT trust it.\n3. Use DIFFERENT search queries than what was tried before. Search for each entity separately.\n4. Carefully check dates, names, and facts in the search results before concluding.\n5.
