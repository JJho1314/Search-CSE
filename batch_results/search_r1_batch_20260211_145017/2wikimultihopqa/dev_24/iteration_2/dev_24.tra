For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Who is Catherine Of Pomerania, Countess Palatine Of Neumarkt's father-in-law?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  Another strategy involves using a pre-built knowledge graph or database that stores historical relationships. This approach leverages a graph database system like Neo4j to query the relationships between historical figures. The key data structures include a graph representation of the historical figures and their relationships. The time complexity can be optimized to O(log n) using indexing, and the space complexity is O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the graph.\n"
