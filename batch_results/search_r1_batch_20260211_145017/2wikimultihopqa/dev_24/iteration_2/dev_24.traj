This approach leverages a graph database system like Neo4j to query the relationships between historical figures. The key data structures include a graph representation of the historical figures and their relationships. The time complexity can be optimized to O(log n) using indexing, and the space complexity is O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the graph.\n",
