After reasoning, if you find you lack some knowledge, you can call a search engine by <search> query </search> and it will return the top searched results between <information> and </information>.

For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Who is Catherine Of Pomerania, Countess Palatine Of Neumarkt's father-in-law?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  A heuristic approach involves leveraging historical texts and documents that are manually curated. The core logic involves searching through these documents, applying natural language processing techniques to extract relevant information, and then using heuristics to determine the father-in-law. Key data structures include a corpus of historical texts, a tokenizer, and a set of rules for extracting and validating relationships. The time complexity can range from O(n log n) for sorting and searching to O(n^2) for more complex text analysis. The space complexity is O(n) for the text corpus and O(m) for the processed data where n is the number of documents and m is the size of the processed data.\n"
