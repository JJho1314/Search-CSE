For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Who is Catherine Of Pomerania, Countess Palatine Of Neumarkt's father-in-law?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  Lastly, we can use a hybrid approach that combines a knowledge graph with a machine learning model. This involves querying the knowledge graph to get initial results and then using the machine learning model to refine and verify the answer. The key data structures include the graph representation and the trained machine learning model. The time complexity for this approach is a combination of O(log n) for the graph query and O(n * m) for the model inference, resulting in an overall complexity that is optimized based on the specific query. The space complexity is O(n) for the graph and O(p) for the model parameters.\n",
