After reasoning, if you find you lack some knowledge, you can call a search engine by <search> query </search> and it will return the top searched results between <information> and </information>. You can search as many times as you want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Who is Catherine Of Pomerania, Countess Palatine Of Neumarkt's father-in-law?\n\nIMPORTANT: Your previous attempt gave a WRONG answer. The previous attempt is shown below.\nYou MUST NOT repeat the same wrong answer. The answer shown below is INCORRECT.\nTry completely different search queries and reasoning to find the correct answer.\n\n### SOURCE TRAJECTORY SUMMARY\n  iter1_sol5\n  label: iter1_sol5\n  solution:\n  ```\n  <think>Earlier, I tried to provide an answer without proper reasoning. Let's start by re-reading the question: \"Who is Catherine Of Pomerania, Countess Palatine Of Neumarkt's father-in-law?\" We need to find out who her husband was first.</think>\n  <search>Catherine Of Pomerania, Countess Palatine Of Neumarkt husband</search>\n  <information>\n  [Catherine of Pomerania, Countess Palatine of Neumarkt was the wife of Sigismund II Augustus, King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania.]\n  </information>\n  <think>From the search result, we know that Catherine of Pomerania, Countess Palatine of Neumarkt was married to Sigismund II Augustus, who was the King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania. Therefore, Sigismund II Augustus is her father-in-law.</think>\n  <answer>Sigismund II Augustus</answer>\n  ```\n  metric: 0.0\n  summary:\n    solution_name: direct_search\n    approach_summary: The agent adopted a direct search approach, first re-reading the question and then searching for the husband of Catherine of Pomerania, Countess Palatine of Neumarkt. Once the husband was identified as Sigismund II Augustus, the agent correctly deduced that he was her father-in-law. However, the final answer did not match the ground truth, indicating a mismatch in the expected answer format.\n    search_queries:\n      - <search>Catherine Of Pomerania, Countess Palatine Of Neumarkt husband</search>\n      - Effective as it helped identify the husband\n    reasoning_quality: Logical, but the reasoning was interrupted by a previous incorrect attempt. The agent correctly deduced the answer from the search results.\n    answer_quality: The final answer, 'Sigismund II Augustus,' directly addresses the question, but the ground truth indicates a different expected answer format.\n    key_learnings:\n      - The agent should ensure that the final answer matches the expected format as noted in the ground truth.\n      - Re-reading and understanding the question carefully is crucial before initiating a search.\n      - The strategy of directly searching for the necessary information is effective, but the final answer should be cross-verified with the expected format.\n  iteration: 5\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Sigismund II Augustus\n    ground_truth:\n      - Rupert, King of Germany\n      - Rupert\n      - Ruprecht\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: False\n    subem_match: False\n    failure_reason: Answer 'Sigismund II Augustus' does not match any of ['Rupert, King of Germany', 'Rupert', 'Ruprecht']\n  source_entry_labels:\n\n  operator_name: plan\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\nRules:\n1. The answer in the previous attempt is WRONG — NEVER give that same answer again.\n2. The information that led to that wrong answer may also be wrong — do NOT trust it.\n3. Use DIFFERENT search queries than what was tried before. Search for each entity separately.\n4. Carefully check dates, names, and facts in the search results before concluding.\n5.
