After the initial query, the agent reasoned that Frederick I of Saxony was her husband, thus he is her father-in-law. The agent then provided the answer based on the reasoning.\n    search_queries:\n      - <search>Catherine of Pomerania, Countess Palatine of Neumarkt's father-in-law</search>\n    reasoning_quality: Logical and straightforward. The agent correctly identified the husband from the search results and deduced the father-in-law relationship.\n    answer_quality: 0.0\n    key_learnings:\n      - The agent's reasoning was correct, but the final answer did not match the ground truth. This suggests that the ground truth information provided might be using a different name for Frederick I of Saxony (such as Rupert, King of Germany or Rupert).\n      - It is important to cross-reference names and titles when dealing with historical figures to ensure accuracy.\n      - A more detailed search or cross-referencing with additional sources might have improved the answer match.\n  iteration: 4\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Frederick I of Saxony\n    ground_truth:\n      - Rupert, King of Germany\n      - Rupert\n      - Ruprecht\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: False\n    subem_match: False\n    failure_reason: Answer 'Frederick I of Saxony' does not match any of ['Rupert, King of Germany', 'Rupert', 'Ruprecht']\n  source_entry_labels:\n\n  operator_name: plan\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\nRules:\n1.
