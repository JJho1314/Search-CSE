After reasoning, if you find you lack some knowledge, you can call a search engine by <search> query </search> and it will return the top searched results between <information> and </information>. You can search as many times as you want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Who is Catherine Of Pomerania, Countess Palatine Of Neumarkt's father-in-law?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  We can also employ a machine learning model that has been trained on historical texts and documents to identify the father-in-law. This involves preprocessing the text data, training a model like BERT or LSTM to classify the relationships, and then querying the model to find the answer. The core logic involves tokenizing the query and feeding it into the model. The time complexity for model inference is typically O(n * m) where n is the number of tokens and m is the complexity of the model. The space complexity is O(n) for the input and O(p) for the model parameters where p is the model size.\n"
