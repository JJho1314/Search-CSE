I already know from previous searches that Catherine of Pomerania was married to Frederick I, Elector of Saxony.

Therefore, Catherine of Pomerania's father-in-law is also Rupert, King of Germany.\n  </think>\n  <answer>Rupert, King of Germany</answer>\n  ```\n  metric: 1.0\n  summary:\n    solution_name: direct_search_with_name_normalization\n    approach_summary: The agent used a direct search approach to find information about Frederick I, Elector of Saxony's father-in-law. The agent reasoned that since Catherine of Pomerania was married to Frederick I, her father-in-law would be the same as Frederick I's father-in-law. The agent searched for information about Frederick I, Elector of Saxony and found that his father-in-law was Rupert, King of Germany. This approach was effective as it led to the correct answer.\n    search_queries:\n      - <search>Frederick I, Elector of Saxony father-in-law</search>\n    reasoning_quality: Logical and effective. The agent correctly deduced the correct answer by reasoning about the family relationships.\n    answer_quality: 1.0\n    key_learnings:\n      - Ensuring proper name normalization and mapping between different names used in historical contexts is crucial.\n      - Cross-referencing names and titles with multiple sources can improve accuracy.\n      - Focusing on specific aspects of historical figures, such as their family relationships, can lead to more direct answers.\n  iteration: 19\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Rupert, King of Germany\n    ground_truth:\n      - Rupert, King of Germany\n      - Rupert\n      - Ruprecht\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: True\n    subem_match: True\n  source_entry_labels:\n    - iter1_sol11\n    - iter1_sol14\n  operator_name: crossover\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\nRules:\n1. The answer in the previous attempt is WRONG — NEVER give that same answer again.\n2. The information that led to that wrong answer may also be wrong — do NOT trust it.\n3. Use DIFFERENT search queries than what was tried before. Search for each entity separately.\n4. Carefully check dates, names, and facts in the search results before concluding.\n5.
