This can be done using a REST API or a database query. The core logic involves making a request to the data source, parsing the JSON response, and extracting the father-in-law's name. The expected time complexity is O(1) as the lookup is a constant-time operation. The space complexity is also O(1) as the response size is fixed.\n",
