From the previous attempts, we know that Catherine of Pomerania was married to Frederick I, Elector of Saxony, and her father-in-law was Rupert, King of Germany.

The agent corrected the name discrepancy from previous attempts and used the information provided to deduce the correct answer.\n    answer_quality: 1.0\n    key_learnings:\n      - Ensuring proper name normalization and mapping between different names used in historical contexts is crucial.\n      - Cross-referencing names and titles with multiple sources can improve accuracy.\n      - Focusing on specific aspects of historical figures, such as their family relationships, can lead to more direct answers.\n  iteration: 13\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Rupert, King of Germany\n    ground_truth:\n      - Rupert, King of Germany\n      - Rupert\n      - Ruprecht\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: True\n    subem_match: True\n  source_entry_labels:\n    - iter1_sol11\n    - iter1_sol8\n  operator_name: crossover\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\nRules:\n1. The answer in the previous attempt is WRONG \u2014 NEVER give that same answer again.\n2. The information that led to that wrong answer may also be wrong \u2014 do NOT trust it.\n3.
