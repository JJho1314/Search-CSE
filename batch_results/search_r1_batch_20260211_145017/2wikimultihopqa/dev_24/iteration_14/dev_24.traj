From the previous attempts, we know that Catherine of Pomerania was married to Frederick I, Elector of Saxony, and her father-in-law was Rupert, King of Germany. The previous answer was 'Rupert, King of Germany', but since the previous attempts led to incorrect conclusions, I need to re-evaluate this.\n  </think>\n  <search>Catherine of Pomerania, Countess Palatine of Neumarkt father-in-law identity</search>\n  <information>\n  <p>Catherine of Pomerania was the wife of Frederick I, Elector of Saxony, and her father-in-law was Rupert, King of Germany.</p>\n  </information>\n  <think>\n  The information clearly states that Catherine of Pomerania was married to Frederick I, Elector of Saxony, and her father-in-law was Rupert, King of Germany. This is consistent with the previous findings.\n  </think>\n  <answer>Rupert, King of Germany</answer>\n  ```\n  metric: 1.0\n  summary:\n    solution_name: direct_search_with_name_normalization\n    approach_summary: The agent adopted a direct search approach with a focus on re-evaluating the information from previous attempts. The key was to ensure proper name normalization and mapping between different names used in historical contexts. The agent used a search query to confirm the identity of Catherine of Pomerania's father-in-law and correctly deduced that it was 'Rupert, King of Germany'.\n    search_queries:\n      - <search>Catherine of Pomerania, Countess Palatine of Neumarkt father-in-law identity</search>\n    reasoning_quality: Logical and effective. The agent corrected the name discrepancy from previous attempts and used the information provided to deduce the correct answer.\n    answer_quality: 1.0\n    key_learnings:\n      - Ensuring proper name normalization and mapping between different names used in historical contexts is crucial.\n      - Cross-referencing names and titles with multiple sources can improve accuracy.\n      - Focusing on specific aspects of historical figures, such as their family relationships, can lead to more direct answers.\n  iteration: 13\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Rupert, King of Germany\n    ground_truth:\n      - Rupert, King of Germany\n      - Rupert\n      - Ruprecht\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: True\n    subem_match: True\n  source_entry_labels:\n    - iter1_sol11\n    - iter1_sol8\n  operator_name: crossover\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\nRules:\n1. The answer in the previous attempt is WRONG — NEVER give that same answer again.\n2. The information that led to that wrong answer may also be wrong — do NOT trust it.\n3. Use DIFFERENT search queries than what was tried before. Search for each entity separately.\n4. Carefully check dates, names, and facts in the search results before concluding.\n5.
