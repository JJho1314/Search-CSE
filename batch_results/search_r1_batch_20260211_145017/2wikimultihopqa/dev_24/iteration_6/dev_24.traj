Initially, it searched for Catherine of Pomerania's husband, which led to Elector Rupert III of the Palatinate. Then, it searched for Elector Rupert III's father, which resulted in Rupert II, Elector Palatine, who was identified as Catherine of Pomerania's father-in-law.\n    search_queries:\n      - <search>Catherine of Pomerania, Countess Palatine of Neumarkt husband</search>\n      - <search>Elector Rupert III of the Palatinate father</search>\n    reasoning_quality: Logical reasoning was applied step-by-step to trace the lineage from Catherine of Pomerania to her father-in-law. The only missed connection was in the final answer, where the name 'Rupert II, Elector Palatine' was provided, but the exact match was 'Rupert, King of Germany', 'Rupert', or 'Ruprecht'.\n    answer_quality: The final answer correctly identified Rupert II, Elector Palatine as Catherine of Pomerania's father-in-law, but it was not an exact match due to the discrepancy in the expected answer format.\n    key_learnings:\n      - Effective multi-hop reasoning is crucial when dealing with lineage or family history questions.\n      - Attention to detail in matching the exact answer format is essential, even if the reasoning process is correct.\n      - The search strategy was effective, but the need for precise matching of names highlights the importance of understanding the expected answer format.\n  iteration: 1\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Rupert II, Elector Palatine\n    ground_truth:\n      - Rupert, King of Germany\n      - Rupert\n      - Ruprecht\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: False\n    subem_match: True\n    failure_reason: Answer 'Rupert II, Elector Palatine' does not match any of ['Rupert, King of Germany', 'Rupert', 'Ruprecht']\n  source_entry_labels:\n\n  operator_name: plan\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\nRules:\n1. The answer in the previous attempt is WRONG — NEVER give that same answer again.\n2. The information that led to that wrong answer may also be wrong — do NOT trust it.\n3. Use DIFFERENT search queries than what was tried before. Search for each entity separately.\n4. Carefully check dates, names, and facts in the search results before concluding.\n5.
