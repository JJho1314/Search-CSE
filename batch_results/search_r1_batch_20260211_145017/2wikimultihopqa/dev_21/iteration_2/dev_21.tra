For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: What nationality is the director of film World And Time Enough?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  Implement a Trie data structure to store the names of directors and their nationalities, enabling efficient insertion and search operations. Traverse the Trie to find the director's name and retrieve the nationality. The expected time complexity is O(m), where m is the length of the director's name, and the space complexity is O(n * m).\n"
