The agent correctly identified the director as Walter Hill and found that he is American. However, the final answer 'American' did not match the expected answer format, which includes multiple possible correct answers like 'U.S.A.', 'US', etc.\n    search_queries:\n      - <search>director of the film World And Time Enough</search>\n      - <search>Walter Hill nationality</search>\n    reasoning_quality: Logical, the agent correctly followed the steps to find the director and then his nationality. However, the reasoning could have been more specific in considering the expected answer format.\n    answer_quality: The answer is correct in terms of content but not in the expected format, leading to an incorrect match.\n    key_learnings:\n      - Ensure that the answer matches the expected format, especially when multiple correct answers are provided.\n      - Consider the specific context and expected answer format when searching for information.\n  iteration: 2\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: American\n    ground_truth:\n      - U.S.A.\n      - US of A\n      - US\n      - United States of America\n      - USA\n      - the United States of America\n      - United States\n      - the US\n      - 🇺🇸\n      - the United States\n      - U.S.\n      - America\n      - the USA\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: False\n    subem_match: True\n    failure_reason: Answer 'American' does not match any of ['U.S.A.', 'US of A', 'US', 'United States of America', 'USA', 'the United States of America', 'United States', 'the US', '🇺🇸', 'the United States', 'U.S.', 'America', 'the USA']\n  source_entry_labels:\n\n  operator_name: plan\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\nRules:\n1.
