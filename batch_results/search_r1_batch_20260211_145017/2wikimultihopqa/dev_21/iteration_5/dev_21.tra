For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: What nationality is the director of film World And Time Enough?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  Apply dynamic programming to build a table where each entry represents whether a director's name matches the given film title. The table is updated based on the longest common prefix of the director's name and the film title. The expected time complexity is O(n * m), where n is the number of directors and m is the length of the film title, and the space complexity is O(n).\n"
