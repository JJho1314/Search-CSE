Initialize two pointers to the start and end of the sorted list. Move the pointers towards each other until the husband of Anastasia of Serbia is found. This method is efficient if the data is already sorted. The time complexity is O(n) for preprocessing the data and O(1) for the query, and the space complexity is O(1).\n",
