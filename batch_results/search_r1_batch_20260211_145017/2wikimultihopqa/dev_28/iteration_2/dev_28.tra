For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Where was the place of death of Anastasia Of Serbia's husband?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  Utilize a Trie data structure to preprocess the data. This allows for fast prefix-based searches. We insert all names and their corresponding places of death into the Trie. During the query, we traverse the Trie to find the husband of Anastasia of Serbia and retrieve the place of death. The preprocessing step has a time complexity of O(n * m) where n is the number of entries and m is the average length of names. The query time is O(m) and space complexity is O(n * m).\n"
