For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Where was the place of death of Anastasia Of Serbia's husband?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  Employ a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) to support efficient range queries. Preprocess the data to store the places of death in a BIT. For each entry, we update the BIT with the place of death. During the query, we can quickly find the place of death by querying the BIT. The preprocessing step to build the BIT takes O(n log n) time, and each query takes O(log n) time. The space complexity is O(n).\n",
