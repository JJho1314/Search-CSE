After reasoning, if you find you lack some knowledge, you can call a search engine by <search> query </search> and it will return the top searched results between <information> and </information>. You can search as many times as you want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Where was the place of death of Anastasia Of Serbia's husband?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  Employ a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) to support efficient range queries. Preprocess the data to store the places of death in a BIT. For each entry, we update the BIT with the place of death. During the query, we can quickly find the place of death by querying the BIT. The preprocessing step to build the BIT takes O(n log n) time, and each query takes O(log n) time. The space complexity is O(n).\n"
