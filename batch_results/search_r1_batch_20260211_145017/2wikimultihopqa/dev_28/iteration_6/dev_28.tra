Initially, it searched for information about Anastasia of Serbia and her husband, followed by a search for the place of death of her husband. This approach allowed the agent to directly find the answer without needing to apply complex algorithms or multi-step reasoning.\n    search_queries:\n      - <search>Anastasia of Serbia husband</search>\n      - <search>Stephen Uro\u0161 IV Du\u0161an place of death</search>\n    search_queries_effectiveness:\n      - Effective, as it provided the name of her husband, Stephen Uro\u0161 IV Du\u0161an.\n      - Effective, as it directly provided the place of death (Belgrade).\n    reasoning_quality: Logical and direct. The agent efficiently used the information obtained from each search to form a clear and correct conclusion.\n    answer_quality: The final answer 'Belgrade' directly addresses the question.\n    key_learnings:\n      - Using direct searches is effective for straightforward factual questions.\n      - The strategy of breaking down the question into smaller, manageable parts (e.g., finding the name of the husband first) can lead to a correct answer efficiently.\n      - Ensure the final answer matches the format and expected output format (e.g., exact matches for names).\n  iteration: 4\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Belgrade\n    ground_truth:\n      - Hilandar\n      - Helandar\n      - Manastir Hilandar\n      - Hilandar Monastery\n      - Hilandariu\n      - Hilendar\n      - \u03a7\u03b9\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03c1\u03af\u03bf\u03c5\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: False\n    subem_match: False\n    failure_reason: Answer 'Belgrade' does not match any of ['Hilandar', 'Helandar', 'Manastir Hilandar', 'Hilandar Monastery', 'Hilandariu', 'Hilendar', '\u03a7\u03b9\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03c1\u03af\u03bf\u03c5']\n  source_entry_labels:\n\n  operator_name: plan\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\nRules:\n1.
