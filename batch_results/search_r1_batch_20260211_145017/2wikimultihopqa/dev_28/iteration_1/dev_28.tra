For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Where was the place of death of Anastasia Of Serbia's husband?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  A straightforward approach involves using a hash map to store the place of death for each historical figure. Given the limited number of entries, this method is efficient. For each entry in the data, we check if the husband of Anastasia of Serbia is mentioned, and then retrieve the place of death from the hash map. The time complexity is O(n) where n is the number of entries, and the space complexity is also O(n) due to the hash map storage.\n"
