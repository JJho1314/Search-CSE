For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Where was the place of death of Anastasia Of Serbia's husband?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  Implement a Binary Search Tree (BST) to store the data. Each node in the BST contains the name of the historical figure and the place of death. We first sort the entries by the name of the historical figure and then build the BST. During the query, we perform a binary search to find the husband of Anastasia of Serbia. The preprocessing step sorts the data in O(n log n) time and builds the BST in O(n) time. The query time is O(log n) and space complexity is O(n).\n"
