We would start from Marie Zéphyrine and recursively move up the family tree to find her paternal grandmother. This would involve a recursive call stack, making the Time Complexity O(n) in the worst case, and Space Complexity O(n) due to the recursive stack. The function would check the parent and grandparent relationships to find the correct ancestor.\n",
