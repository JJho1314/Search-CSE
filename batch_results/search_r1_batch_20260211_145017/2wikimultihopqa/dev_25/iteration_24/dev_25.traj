It started by identifying her father and then confirmed her paternal grandmother through a focused search query. The agent ensured the correctness by directly referencing the search result and avoiding repetition of previous incorrect answers.\n    search_queries:\n      - <search>paternal grandmother of Marie Zéphyrine of France</search>\n    reasoning_quality: Logical but with initial misidentification. The agent correctly traced the paternal lineage but initially identified the wrong grandmother until the search query provided the correct information.\n    answer_quality: Correct. The final answer, 'Marie Leszczyńska', directly addresses the question and matches the ground truth.\n    key_learnings:\n      - The multi-hop reasoning approach is effective for tracing familial relationships.\n      - Cross-referencing information from multiple sources is crucial to ensure accuracy.\n      - Attention to detail and careful checking of names and facts are essential to avoid errors.\n      - The importance of directly searching for the specific information needed rather than relying solely on previously obtained data.\n  iteration: 21\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Marie Leszczyńska\n    ground_truth:\n      - Königin Maria Frankreich\n      - Queen, consort of Louis XV, King of France Marie Leszczyńska\n      - Queen, consort of Louis XV, King of France Maria Leszczyńska\n      - Marie-Catherine Leszczyńska\n      - Marie Leszczyńska\n      - Queen consort of Louis XV Marie Leszczyńska\n      - Marie Leszczyńska reine de France\n      - queen of France Marie Leszczyńska\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: True\n    subem_match: True\n  source_entry_labels:\n    - iter1_sol13\n    - iter1_sol14\n  operator_name: crossover\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\nRules:\n1.
