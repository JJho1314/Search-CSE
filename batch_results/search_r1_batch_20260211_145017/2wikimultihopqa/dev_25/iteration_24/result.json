However, previous answers indicated that the correct answer is Marie Leszczyńska. Let's search for more information to confirm this.\n</think>\n<search>paternal grandmother of Marie Zéphyrine of France</search>\n<information>\nMarie Zéphyrine of France's paternal grandmother was Marie Leszczyńska.\n</information>\n<think>\nThe search result confirms that Marie Zéphyrine of France's paternal grandmother is indeed Marie Leszczyńska. This time, I will ensure the answer is correct by directly referencing the search result and avoiding repetition of previous incorrect answers.\n</think>\n<answer>Marie Leszczyńska</answer>",
