From the previous attempts, we know that Marie Z\u00e9phyrine's father is Louis-Philippe I, King of the French. We also know that Louis-Philippe I's mother is Marie Antoinette. This makes Marie Antoinette the paternal grandmother of Marie Z\u00e9phyrine of France. Let's double-check if there is any other information that might contradict this.\n  </think>\n  <search>paternal grandmother of Marie Z\u00e9phyrine of France</search>\n  <information>\n  Marie Z\u00e9phyrine of France's paternal grandmother was Marie Leszczy\u0144ska.\n  </information>\n  <think>\n  The search result clearly confirms that Marie Z\u00e9phyrine of France's paternal grandmother is Marie Leszczy\u0144ska, not Marie Antoinette. Therefore, the correct answer is Marie Leszczy\u0144ska.\n  </think>\n  <answer>Marie Leszczy\u0144ska</answer>\n  ```\n  metric: 1.0\n  summary:\n    solution_name: multi_hop_v2\n    approach_summary: The agent used a multi-hop reasoning approach to trace the paternal lineage of Marie Z\u00e9phyrine of France. It started by identifying her father and then found her paternal grandmother through a second search query. The agent learned from previous incorrect answers and used a more focused search to confirm the correct paternal grandmother, Marie Leszczy\u0144ska.\n    search_queries:\n      - <search>Louis Antoine, Duke of Angoul\u00eame mother</search>\n      - <search>Marie Z\u00e9phyrine of France father</search>\n      - <search>paternal grandmother of Marie Z\u00e9phyrine of France</search>\n    reasoning_quality: Logical but with initial misidentification. The agent correctly traced the paternal lineage but initially identified the wrong grandmother until the second search provided the correct information.\n    answer_quality: Correct. The final answer, 'Marie Leszczy\u0144ska', directly addresses the question and matches the ground truth.\n    key_learnings:\n      - The multi-hop reasoning approach is effective for tracing familial relationships.\n      - Cross-referencing information from multiple sources is crucial to ensure accuracy.\n      - Attention to detail and careful checking of names and facts are essential to avoid errors.\n      - The importance of directly searching for the specific information needed rather than relying solely on previously obtained data.\n  iteration: 13\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Marie Leszczy\u0144ska\n    ground_truth:\n      - K\u00f6nigin Maria Frankreich\n      - Queen, consort of Louis XV, King of France Marie Leszczy\u0144ska\n      - Queen, consort of Louis XV, King of France Maria Leszczy\u0144ska\n      - Marie-Catherine Leszczy\u0144ska\n      - Marie Leszczy\u0144ska\n      - Queen consort of Louis XV Marie Leszczy\u0144ska\n      - Marie Leszczy\u0144ska reine de France\n      - queen of France Marie Leszczy\u0144ska\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: True\n    subem_match: True\n  source_entry_labels:\n    - iter1_sol12\n    - iter1_sol9\n  operator_name: crossover\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\nRules:\n1.
