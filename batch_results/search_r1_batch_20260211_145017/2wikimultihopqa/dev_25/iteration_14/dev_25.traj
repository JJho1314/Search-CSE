You can search as many times as you want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations.

The previous attempt is shown below.\nYou MUST NOT repeat the same wrong answer. The answer shown below is INCORRECT.\nTry completely different search queries and reasoning to find the correct answer.\n\n### SOURCE TRAJECTORY SUMMARY\n  iter1_sol13\n  label: iter1_sol13\n  solution:\n  ```\n  <think>\n  The question asks about Marie Zéphyrine of France's paternal grandmother. From the previous attempts, we know that Marie Zéphyrine's father is Louis-Philippe I, King of the French. We also know that Louis-Philippe I's mother is Marie Antoinette. This makes Marie Antoinette the paternal grandmother of Marie Zéphyrine of France. Let's double-check if there is any other information that might contradict this.\n  </think>\n  <search>paternal grandmother of Marie Zéphyrine of France</search>\n  <information>\n  Marie Zéphyrine of France's paternal grandmother was Marie Leszczyńska.\n  </information>\n  <think>\n  The search result clearly confirms that Marie Zéphyrine of France's paternal grandmother is Marie Leszczyńska, not Marie Antoinette. Therefore, the correct answer is Marie Leszczyńska.\n  </think>\n  <answer>Marie Leszczyńska</answer>\n  ```\n  metric: 1.0\n  summary:\n    solution_name: multi_hop_v2\n    approach_summary: The agent used a multi-hop reasoning approach to trace the paternal lineage of Marie Zéphyrine of France. It started by identifying her father and then found her paternal grandmother through a second search query. The agent learned from previous incorrect answers and used a more focused search to confirm the correct paternal grandmother, Marie Leszczyńska.\n    search_queries:\n      - <search>Louis Antoine, Duke of Angoulême mother</search>\n      - <search>Marie Zéphyrine of France father</search>\n      - <search>paternal grandmother of Marie Zéphyrine of France</search>\n    reasoning_quality: Logical but with initial misidentification. The agent correctly traced the paternal lineage but initially identified the wrong grandmother until the second search provided the correct information.\n    answer_quality: Correct. The final answer, 'Marie Leszczyńska', directly addresses the question and matches the ground truth.\n    key_learnings:\n      - The multi-hop reasoning approach is effective for tracing familial relationships.\n      - Cross-referencing information from multiple sources is crucial to ensure accuracy.\n      - Attention to detail and careful checking of names and facts are essential to avoid errors.\n      - The importance of directly searching for the specific information needed rather than relying solely on previously obtained data.\n  iteration: 13\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Marie Leszczyńska\n    ground_truth:\n      - Königin Maria Frankreich\n      - Queen, consort of Louis XV, King of France Marie Leszczyńska\n      - Queen, consort of Louis XV, King of France Maria Leszczyńska\n      - Marie-Catherine Leszczyńska\n      - Marie Leszczyńska\n      - Queen consort of Louis XV Marie Leszczyńska\n      - Marie Leszczyńska reine de France\n      - queen of France Marie Leszczyńska\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: True\n    subem_match: True\n  source_entry_labels:\n    - iter1_sol12\n    - iter1_sol9\n  operator_name: crossover\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\nRules:\n1. The answer in the previous attempt is WRONG — NEVER give that same answer again.\n2. The information that led to that wrong answer may also be wrong — do NOT trust it.\n3. Use DIFFERENT search queries than what was tried before. Search for each entity separately.\n4. Carefully check dates, names, and facts in the search results before concluding.\n5.
