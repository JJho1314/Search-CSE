However, we need to find out if Blanche of Castile is the paternal grandmother of Marie Zéphyrine of France. Since Louis VIII of France is the father of Louis Antoine, Blanche of Castile is Louis Antoine's mother, and hence the paternal grandmother of Marie Zéphyrine of France.\n\n  But, let's cross-check if there are any other names or additional information that might provide more clarity.\n  </think>\n  <search>paternal grandmother of Marie Zéphyrine of France</search>\n  <information>\n  Marie Zéphyrine of France's paternal grandmother was Marie Leszczyńska.\n  </information>\n  <think>\n  The search result clearly states that Marie Zéphyrine of France's paternal grandmother is Marie Leszczyńska.
