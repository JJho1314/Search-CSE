    "solution": "<think>\nThe question asks about Marie Zéphyrine of France's paternal grandmother. From the previous attempts, we know that Marie Zéphyrine's father is Louis-Philippe I, King of the French. We also know that Louis-Philippe I's mother is Marie Antoinette. This makes Marie Antoinette the paternal grandmother of Marie Zéphyrine of France. Let's double-check if there is any other information that might contradict this.\n</think>\n<search>paternal grandmother of Marie Zéphyrine of France</search>\n<information>\nMarie Zéphyrine of France's paternal grandmother was Marie Leszczyńska.\n</information>\n<think>\nThe search result clearly confirms that Marie Zéphyrine of France's paternal grandmother is Marie Leszczyńska, not Marie Antoinette. Therefore, the correct answer is Marie Leszczyńska.\n</think>\n<answer>Marie Leszczyńska</answer>",
