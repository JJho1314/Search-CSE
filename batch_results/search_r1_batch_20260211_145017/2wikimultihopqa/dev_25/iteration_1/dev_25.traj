However, if we were to model it using a database, we could use a simple query to retrieve the information. We would need a relational database with tables for persons and their familial relationships. The query would join the tables to find the paternal grandmother of Marie Zéphyrine. Time Complexity would be O(n) where n is the number of records in the database, and Space Complexity would be O(1) as we are only retrieving a single record.\n",
