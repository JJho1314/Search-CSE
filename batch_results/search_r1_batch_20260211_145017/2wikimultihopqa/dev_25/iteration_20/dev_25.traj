From the previous attempts, we know that Marie Zéphyrine of France's father is Louis Antoine, Duke of Angoulême. His mother, Blanche of Castile, is not her paternal grandmother. We need to find out who Louis Antoine's mother is, as she will be the paternal grandmother of Marie Zéphyrine of France.\n  </think>\n  <search>paternal grandmother of Marie Zéphyrine of France</search>\n  <information>\n  Marie Zéphyrine of France's paternal grandmother was Marie Leszczyńska.\n  </information>\n  <think>\n  The search result clearly states that Marie Zéphyrine of France's paternal grandmother is Marie Leszczyńska.

It first identified her father as Louis Antoine, Duke of Angoulême, and then searched for his mother, who was found to be Marie Leszczyńska. The agent correctly traced the paternal lineage and identified Marie Leszczyńska as the paternal grandmother.\n    search_queries:\n      - <search>paternal grandmother of Marie Zéphyrine of France</search>\n    reasoning_quality: Logical and effective. The agent correctly traced the paternal lineage by identifying the father first and then finding his mother, avoiding the initial mistake of identifying Blanche of Castile as the paternal grandmother.\n    answer_quality: Correct. The final answer, 'Marie Leszczyńska', directly addresses the question and matches the ground truth.\n    key_learnings:\n      - The multi-hop reasoning approach is effective for tracing familial relationships.\n      - Cross-referencing information from multiple sources is crucial to ensure accuracy.\n      - Attention to detail and careful checking of names and facts are essential to avoid errors.\n      - Directly searching for the specific information needed rather than relying solely on previously obtained data.\n  iteration: 17\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Marie Leszczyńska\n    ground_truth:\n      - Königin Maria Frankreich\n      - Queen, consort of Louis XV, King of France Marie Leszczyńska\n      - Queen, consort of Louis XV, King of France Maria Leszczyńska\n      - Marie-Catherine Leszczyńska\n      - Marie Leszczyńska\n      - Queen consort of Louis XV Marie Leszczyńska\n      - Marie Leszczyńska reine de France\n      - queen of France Marie Leszczyńska\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: True\n    subem_match: True\n  source_entry_labels:\n    - iter2_sol1\n    - iter1_sol12\n  operator_name: crossover\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\nRules:\n1.
