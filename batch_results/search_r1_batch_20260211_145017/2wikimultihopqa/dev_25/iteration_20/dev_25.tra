It first identified her father as Louis Antoine, Duke of Angoul\u00eame, and then searched for his mother, who was found to be Marie Leszczy\u0144ska.

The agent correctly traced the paternal lineage by identifying the father first and then finding his mother, avoiding the initial mistake of identifying Blanche of Castile as the paternal grandmother.\n    answer_quality: Correct. The final answer, 'Marie Leszczy\u0144ska', directly addresses the question and matches the ground truth.\n    key_learnings:\n      - The multi-hop reasoning approach is effective for tracing familial relationships.\n      - Cross-referencing information from multiple sources is crucial to ensure accuracy.\n      - Attention to detail and careful checking of names and facts are essential to avoid errors.\n      - Directly searching for the specific information needed rather than relying solely on previously obtained data.\n  iteration: 17\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Marie Leszczy\u0144ska\n    ground_truth:\n      - K\u00f6nigin Maria Frankreich\n      - Queen, consort of Louis XV, King of France Marie Leszczy\u0144ska\n      - Queen, consort of Louis XV, King of France Maria Leszczy\u0144ska\n      - Marie-Catherine Leszczy\u0144ska\n      - Marie Leszczy\u0144ska\n      - Queen consort of Louis XV Marie Leszczy\u0144ska\n      - Marie Leszczy\u0144ska reine de France\n      - queen of France Marie Leszczy\u0144ska\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: True\n    subem_match: True\n  source_entry_labels:\n    - iter2_sol1\n    - iter1_sol12\n  operator_name: crossover\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\nRules:\n1.
