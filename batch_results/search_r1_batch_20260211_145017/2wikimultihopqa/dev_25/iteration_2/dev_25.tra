We would start from Marie Z\u00e9phyrine and traverse the graph to find her paternal grandmother. This would involve a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from her, moving one level up in each iteration until we reach her paternal grandmother. The Time Complexity would be O(n) in the worst case, and Space Complexity would be O(n) due to the queue used in BFS.\n"
