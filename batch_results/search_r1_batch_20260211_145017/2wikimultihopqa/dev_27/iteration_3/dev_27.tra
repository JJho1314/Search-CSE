Once found, move to the next film and find the director and their spouse. This approach works well if the list of films is already partially sorted. Key data structures: List, Sorted List. Expected Time Complexity: O(N log N) for sorting and O(N) for two-pointer traversal, resulting in O(N log N). Space Complexity: O(1) if in-place sorting is used.}\n"
