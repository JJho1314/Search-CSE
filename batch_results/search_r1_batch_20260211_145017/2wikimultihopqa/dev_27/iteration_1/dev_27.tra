For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Who is the spouse of the director of film Eden And After?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  {\"name\": \"Graph Traversal\", \"logic\": \"Create a graph where each actor and film is a node. Use Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to traverse the graph starting from the film 'Eden And After'. The target node will be the director. From there, traverse until finding the spouse node. This approach leverages graph traversal techniques to efficiently find the required information. Key data structures: Graph, Stack (for DFS) or Queue (for BFS). Expected Time Complexity: O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges. Space Complexity: O(V) for DFS and O(V + E) for BFS due to recursion stack or queue.}\n"
