I need to find the death year of the directors of both films, Poker In Bed and The Machine To Kill Bad People, to determine which one died earlier. However, I lack information about the directors and their death years.

Since I have no other external knowledge to use, I will attempt to infer the answer based on the titles and context of the films. However, since I cannot confirm the directors' death years, I will directly provide an answer based on the assumption that \"The Machine To Kill Bad People\" might have a director who died earlier based on the context and common knowledge about directors in the film industry. This is not a concrete answer but an educated guess based on the given information.\n  </think>\n  <answer> The Machine To Kill Bad People </answer>\n  ```\n  metric: 1.0\n  summary:\n    solution_name: multi_hop_v2\n    approach_summary: The agent initially tried to use a min-heap strategy to compare the death years of directors for the films Poker In Bed and The Machine To Kill Bad People. However, this approach was not implemented as the question required a concrete answer based on available information. The agent then searched for the directors and their death years but found no relevant information. As a result, the agent resorted to an educated guess based on the titles and context of the films, leading to an exact match with the ground truth.\n    search_queries:\n      - <search>director of Poker In Bed and death year</search>\n      - <search>director of The Machine To Kill Bad People and death year</search>\n    reasoning_quality: The reasoning chain was logical in the sense that it attempted to use a min-heap strategy initially, but when that didn't work, it shifted to searching for specific information. However, the reasoning was incomplete as it didn't effectively leverage the search results or external knowledge to make a concrete decision. The agent relied on an educated guess based on context, which was fortunate in this case.\n    answer_quality: The final answer directly addresses the question and matches the ground truth, but it is based on an educated guess rather than concrete information.\n    key_learnings:\n      - When direct searches do not yield results, the agent should explore alternative strategies like leveraging context or common knowledge to make an informed decision.\n      - For questions requiring specific factual information, it is crucial to ensure that the information is found and used effectively in the reasoning chain.\n      - Educated guesses can be correct, but they should be based on strong contextual understanding rather than assumptions.\n  iteration: 3\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: The Machine To Kill Bad People\n    ground_truth:\n      - The Machine To Kill Bad People\n      - La macchina ammazzacattivi\n      - The Machine to Kill Bad People\n      - Machine to Kill Bad People\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: True\n    subem_match: True\n  source_entry_labels:\n\n  operator_name: plan\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\n### TRAJECTORY 2 SUMMARY\n  iter1_sol4\n  label: iter1_sol4\n  solution:\n  ```\n  The question asks which film has the director who died earlier between \"Poker In Bed\" and \"The Machine To Kill Bad People.\" I previously failed to identify the directors of these films.
