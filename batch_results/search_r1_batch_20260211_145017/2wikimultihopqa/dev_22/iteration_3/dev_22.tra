For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Which film has the director died earlier, Poker In Bed or The Machine To Kill Bad People?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  Utilize a min-heap to store the films and their corresponding death years. Insert all films into the heap and then extract the minimum element, which will represent the film with the earliest death year. The heap operations will ensure efficient retrieval of the minimum element. Time Complexity: O(n log n), where n is the number of films. Space Complexity: O(n).\n"
