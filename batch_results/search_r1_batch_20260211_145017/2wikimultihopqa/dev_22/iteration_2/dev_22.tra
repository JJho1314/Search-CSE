You can search as many times as you want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Which film has the director died earlier, Poker In Bed or The Machine To Kill Bad People?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  Sort the films based on the death year of their directors in ascending order. This can be done using a sorting algorithm like Merge Sort or Quick Sort, which have a time complexity of O(n log n). After sorting, the film with the earliest death year will be at the beginning of the list. Space Complexity: O(n) due to the additional space required for the sorted list.\n"
