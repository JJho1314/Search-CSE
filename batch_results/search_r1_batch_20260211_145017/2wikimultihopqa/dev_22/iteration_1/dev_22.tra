For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Which film has the director died earlier, Poker In Bed or The Machine To Kill Bad People?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  Use a hashmap to store the death years of directors along with their film names. Iterate through the data once to populate the hashmap and then find the film with the earliest death year. This approach leverages hashing for efficient lookups. Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of films. Space Complexity: O(n).\n"
