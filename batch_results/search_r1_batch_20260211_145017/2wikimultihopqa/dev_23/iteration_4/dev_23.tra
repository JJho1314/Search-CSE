For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Which film whose director is younger, Heads I Win, Tails You Lose or The Incredible Sarah?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  Apply a two-pointer technique if the films are already sorted by directors' ages. Initialize two pointers, one at the start and one at the end of the list. Compare the ages of the directors at these pointers, and move the pointer to the film with the younger director. Continue this process until the pointers meet. This approach has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1) if the list is sorted in-place.\n"
