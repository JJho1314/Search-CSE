We already know the birth years of the directors:\n- Anna Postle (director of \"The Incredible Sarah\"): 1975\n- Ben Moore (director of \"Heads I Win, Tails You Lose\"): 1987\n\nSince we need to verify if there's any other film to consider, I will search for the birth year of the director of \"The Incredible Sarah\".\n</think>\n<search>birth year of Anna Postle, director of The Incredible Sarah</search>\n<information>\n<information>\n[{\"url\": \"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0308785/\", \"title\": \"The Incredible Sarah (2002) - IMDb\", \"description\": \"The Incredible Sarah is a 2002 British independent film directed by Anna Postle.\"}, {\"url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Postle\", \"title\": \"Anna Postle - Wikipedia\", \"description\": \"Anna Postle (born 22 March 1975) is an English film and television director and screenwriter known for her work on films such as The Incredible Sarah (2002) and The Quick and the Dead (2005).\"}]\n</information>\n<think>\nThe search confirms that Anna Postle was born in 1975. Now I can compare the birth years:\n- Ben Moore: 1987\n- Anna Postle: 1975\n\nSince Anna Postle is younger than Ben Moore, the film with the younger director is \"The Incredible Sarah\".\n</think>\n<answer>The Incredible Sarah</answer>",
