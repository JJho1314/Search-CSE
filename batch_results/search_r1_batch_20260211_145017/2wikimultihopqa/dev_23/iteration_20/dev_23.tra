It iteratively searched for the birth years of Ben Moore and Anna Postle, then compared these birth years to determine which director was younger. The agent verified the birth year of Ben Moore and Anna Postle from Wikipedia and compared them step-by-step.\n    search_queries:\n      - <search>Ben Moore birth year</search>\n      - <search>Anna Postle birth year</search>\n    reasoning_quality: The reasoning was logical and step-by-step. The agent correctly identified the need to find the birth years of the directors and compared them. However, the agent could have streamlined the process by stopping the search once Anna Postle's birth year was found, as the comparison could have been made immediately.\n    answer_quality: The final answer directly addresses the question, correctly identifying 'Heads I Win, Tails You Lose' as the film with the younger director based on the available information.\n    key_learnings:\n      - Direct search for the necessary information is efficient when feasible.\n      - Avoid unnecessary searches once sufficient information has been gathered.\n      - Carefully verify the information found before drawing conclusions.\n  iteration: 13\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Heads I Win, Tails You Lose\n    ground_truth:\n      - Testa o croce\n      - Heads I Win, Tails You Lose\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: True\n    subem_match: True\n  source_entry_labels:\n    - iter1_sol3\n    - iter1_sol9\n  operator_name: crossover\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\nRules:\n1. The answer in the previous attempt is WRONG \u2014 NEVER give that same answer again.\n2. The information that led to that wrong answer may also be wrong \u2014 do NOT trust it.\n3. Use DIFFERENT search queries than what was tried before. Search for each entity separately.\n4. Carefully check dates, names, and facts in the search results before concluding.\n5.
