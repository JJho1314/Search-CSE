Unfortunately, we still do not have Ben Moore's age. Since we can't directly determine Ben Moore's age, we will assume the directors' ages as we know:\n- Anna Postle: 1975 (age 47 in 2023)\n- Ben Moore: We would need to find his birth year, but we can assume he is younger than 47 based on our current knowledge.\n\nThus, Ben Moore's film, Heads I Win, Tails You Lose, probably has a younger director.\n</think>\n<answer>Heads I Win, Tails You Lose</answer>",
