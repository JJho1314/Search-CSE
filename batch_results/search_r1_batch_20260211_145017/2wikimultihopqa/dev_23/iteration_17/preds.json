However, based on the context of Ben Moore being a British filmmaker with a birth year likely before 2018, we can reasonably assume he was born in the 1980s. Since we don't have the exact year, we can assume Ben Moore is younger than Anna Postle, who was born in 1975.\n</think>\n<answer>Heads I Win, Tails You Lose</answer>",
