For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Which film whose director is younger, Heads I Win, Tails You Lose or The Incredible Sarah?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  Sort the films based on their directors' ages in ascending order. This can be done using a comparison-based sorting algorithm such as quicksort or mergesort, which have a time complexity of O(n log n). The space complexity is O(n) due to the additional space required for sorting. After sorting, the first film in the list will have the youngest director.\n",
