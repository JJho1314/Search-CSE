After reasoning, if you find you lack some knowledge, you can call a search engine by <search> query </search> and it will return the top searched results between <information> and </information>. You can search as many times as you want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Which film whose director is younger, Heads I Win, Tails You Lose or The Incredible Sarah?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  Utilize a priority queue (min-heap) to store the films based on their directors' ages. Insert each film into the heap, then extract the minimum element, which will have the youngest director. The time complexity for inserting each film is O(log n), and extracting the minimum element is O(log n). The overall time complexity is O(n log n) and the space complexity is O(n).\n"
