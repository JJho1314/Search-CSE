Iterate through the films, check the director's age for each one, and determine which film has a younger director. This approach leverages a hash map for O(1) average-time complexity lookups. The overall time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of films, and the space complexity is O(m), where m is the number of unique directors.\n"
