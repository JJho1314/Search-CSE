It iteratively searched for the birth year of Ben Moore after successfully finding the birth year of Anna Postle in earlier attempts. The agent then compared these birth years to determine which director was younger.\n    search_queries:\n      - <search>birth year of Ben Moore, director of Heads I Win, Tails You Lose</search>\n      - <search>birth year of Anna Postle, director of The Incredible Sarah</search>\n    reasoning_quality: The reasoning was logical and step-by-step. The agent correctly identified the need to find the birth years of the directors and compared them. However, the agent could have streamlined the process by stopping the search once Anna Postle's birth year was found, as the comparison could have been made immediately.\n    answer_quality: The final answer directly addresses the question, correctly identifying 'Heads I Win, Tails You Lose' as the film with the younger director based on the available information.\n    key_learnings:\n      - Direct search for the necessary information is efficient when feasible.\n      - Avoid unnecessary searches once sufficient information has been gathered.\n      - Carefully verify the dates, names, and facts in the search results before concluding.\n  iteration: 18\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Heads I Win, Tails You Lose\n    ground_truth:\n      - Testa o croce\n      - Heads I Win, Tails You Lose\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: True\n    subem_match: True\n  source_entry_labels:\n    - iter1_sol7\n  operator_name: reflection_refine\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\nRules:\n1. The answer in the previous attempt is WRONG \u2014 NEVER give that same answer again.\n2. The information that led to that wrong answer may also be wrong \u2014 do NOT trust it.\n3.
