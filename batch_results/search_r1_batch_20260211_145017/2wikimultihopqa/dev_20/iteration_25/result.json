I have already searched for the release years of both films and found:\n- \"Moment Of Danger\" was released in 1943.\n- \"The Ballad Of Josie\" was released in 1948.\n\nSince 1943 is earlier than 1948, \"Moment Of Danger\" was released earlier. However, the previous attempts have concluded the same, so I need to verify if there's any new information or potential misunderstanding.\n</think>\n<search>additional information on Moment Of Danger and The Ballad Of Josie</search>\n<information>\nThe information provided in the previous searches is correct. There is no additional information that changes the release years of the films.\n</information>\n<think>\nSince the release years are consistent and no new information has been found, I can confidently conclude that \"Moment Of Danger\" was released earlier than \"The Ballad Of Josie\".\n</think>\n<answer>Moment Of Danger</answer>",
