You can search as many times as you want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Which film was released earlier, Moment Of Danger or The Ballad Of Josie?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  Implement a linear scan through the film names and release years, comparing the years to find the earliest release year. This approach is straightforward and does not require additional data structures beyond the input. The time complexity is O(n) where n is the number of films, and the space complexity is O(1) as no extra space is used other than the input.\n"
