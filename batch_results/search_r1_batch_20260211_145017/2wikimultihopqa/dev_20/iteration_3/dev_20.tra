After reasoning, if you find you lack some knowledge, you can call a search engine by <search> query </search> and it will return the top searched results between <information> and </information>. You can search as many times as you want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Which film was released earlier, Moment Of Danger or The Ballad Of Josie?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  Utilize a binary search tree (BST) to store the films with their release years. Insert both films into the BST and then traverse to find the minimum node, which will contain the film with the earliest release year. This approach leverages the property of BSTs to efficiently find the minimum element. Key data structures include a BST and a comparison function. The time complexity of insertion and finding the minimum is O(log n) on average, and the space complexity is O(n) for storing the BST.\n"
