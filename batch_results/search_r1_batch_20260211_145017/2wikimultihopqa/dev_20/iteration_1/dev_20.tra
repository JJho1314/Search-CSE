You can search as many times as you want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Which film was released earlier, Moment Of Danger or The Ballad Of Josie?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  Use a hash map to store the release years of the films. Compare the years to determine which film was released earlier. This approach leverages constant-time lookups and comparisons. Key data structures include a hash map. The expected time complexity is O(1) for storing and retrieving the release years, and the space complexity is O(1) assuming the years are fixed integers.\n"
