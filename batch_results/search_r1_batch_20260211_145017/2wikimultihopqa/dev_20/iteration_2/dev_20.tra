You can search as many times as you want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Which film was released earlier, Moment Of Danger or The Ballad Of Josie?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  Sort an array of tuples containing the film names and their release years. After sorting, the first element in the sorted array corresponds to the film with the earliest release year. This approach uses a comparison-based sort. Key data structures include an array and a comparison function. The time complexity is O(n log n) where n is the number of films, and the space complexity is O(n) for storing the sorted array.\n"
