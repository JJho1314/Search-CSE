For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Which film was released earlier, Moment Of Danger or The Ballad Of Josie?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  Use a min-heap to store the films with their release years. Insert both films into the min-heap and then extract the element with the smallest release year. This approach leverages the heap data structure to efficiently find the minimum element. Key data structures include a min-heap. The time complexity of insertion and extraction is O(log n) on average, and the space complexity is O(n) for storing the min-heap.\n"
