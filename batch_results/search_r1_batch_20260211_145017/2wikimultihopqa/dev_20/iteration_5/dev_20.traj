Insert both films into the min-heap and then extract the element with the smallest release year. This approach leverages the heap data structure to efficiently find the minimum element. Key data structures include a min-heap. The time complexity of insertion and extraction is O(log n) on average, and the space complexity is O(n) for storing the min-heap.\n",
