After reasoning, if you find you lack some knowledge, you can call a search engine by <search> query </search> and it will return the top searched results between <information> and </information>. You can search as many times as you want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Are Fire In Hell and The Tiger: An Old Hunter'S Tale from the same country?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  Apply a hashing technique to uniquely identify the country of origin for each book. Hash the book title to a unique integer representing its country. Utilize a hash table to store these mappings. The core logic involves hashing the book titles and using the hash as a key to retrieve the country. The time complexity for each query is O(1), and the space complexity is O(N). This method is highly efficient and avoids the overhead of string comparisons.\n"
