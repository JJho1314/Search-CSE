It started by searching for the author of 'Fire In Hell' and then the author of 'The Tiger: An Old Hunter's Tale'. The agent correctly interpreted the search results to conclude that both books were written by American authors, leading to the conclusion that they are from the same country.\n    search_queries:\n      - <search>country of origin Fire In Hell book</search>\n      - <search>country of origin The Tiger: An Old Hunter's Tale book</search>\n    reasoning_quality: Logical and effective. The agent correctly understood that the country of origin could be inferred from the author's nationality and used this information effectively to draw the conclusion.\n    answer_quality: 1.0\n    key_learnings:\n      - Directly searching for the author's nationality can be an effective approach when the required information is readily available through simple queries.\n      - When dealing with questions about the origin of books, searching for the author's background can often provide the necessary context to answer the question.\n  iteration: 6\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Yes\n    ground_truth:\n      - yes\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: True\n    subem_match: True\n  source_entry_labels:\n    - iter1_sol2\n  operator_name: reflection_refine\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\nRules:\n1. The answer in the previous attempt is WRONG — NEVER give that same answer again.\n2. The information that led to that wrong answer may also be wrong — do NOT trust it.\n3. Use DIFFERENT search queries than what was tried before. Search for each entity separately.\n4. Carefully check dates, names, and facts in the search results before concluding.\n5.
