The reasoning was logical as it correctly inferred the country from the author's nationality.\n    search_queries:\n      - <search>country of origin Fire In Hell book</search>\n      - <search>country of origin The Tiger: An Old Hunter's Tale book</search>\n    reasoning_quality: Logical and effective. The agent correctly understood that the country of origin could be inferred from the author's nationality and used this information effectively to draw the conclusion.\n    answer_quality: 1.0\n    key_learnings:\n      - Directly searching for the author's nationality can be an effective approach when the required information is readily available through simple queries.\n      - When dealing with questions about the origin of books, searching for the author's background can often provide the necessary context to answer the question.\n  iteration: 10\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Yes\n    ground_truth:\n      - yes\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: True\n    subem_match: True\n  source_entry_labels:\n    - iter1_sol6\n  operator_name: reflection_refine\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\nRules:\n1. The answer in the previous attempt is WRONG — NEVER give that same answer again.\n2. The information that led to that wrong answer may also be wrong — do NOT trust it.\n3. Use DIFFERENT search queries than what was tried before. Search for each entity separately.\n4. Carefully check dates, names, and facts in the search results before concluding.\n5.
