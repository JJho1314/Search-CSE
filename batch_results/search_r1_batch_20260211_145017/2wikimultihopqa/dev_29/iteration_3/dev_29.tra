After reasoning, if you find you lack some knowledge, you can call a search engine by <search> query </search> and it will return the top searched results between <information> and </information>. You can search as many times as you want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Are Fire In Hell and The Tiger: An Old Hunter'S Tale from the same country?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  Sort the list of books by their titles and then check adjacent pairs to determine if they are from the same country. This approach uses a simple linear scan of the list. The key data structure is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the book title and its country. The time complexity is O(N log N) due to the sorting step, and the space complexity is O(N) for storing the list of book-country pairs. While not as optimal as hash-based methods, it is straightforward and works well for smaller datasets.\n"
