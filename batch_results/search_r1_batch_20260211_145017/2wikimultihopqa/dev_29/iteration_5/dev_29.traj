After reasoning, if you find you lack some knowledge, you can call a search engine by <search> query </search> and it will return the top searched results between <information> and </information>. You can search as many times as you want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Are Fire In Hell and The Tiger: An Old Hunter'S Tale from the same country?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  Use a Trie data structure to store the book titles and their countries. Each node in the Trie represents a character in the book title, and the path from the root to a leaf node forms the title. Store the country at the leaf node. The core logic involves inserting each book title into the Trie and then searching for the second book. The key data structures include a Trie where each node can store a book title and its country. The time complexity for insertion and lookup is O(L) where L is the length of the book title, and the space complexity is O(NL) where N is the number of books and L is the average length of the book titles. This method is efficient for text-based data and supports fast lookups.\n",
