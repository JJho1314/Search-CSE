Despite following the instructions to avoid previous mistakes, the agent repeated the same search and reasoning process, which led to the correct answer. The agent verified the country of publication for both books and concluded that they were from the same country, the United States.\n    search_queries:\n      - <search>country of publication of Fire In Hell book</search>\n      - <search>country of publication of The Tiger: An Old Hunter's Tale book</search>\n    reasoning_quality: Logical but repetitive. The agent correctly identified the need to verify the publication details to confirm the country of origin. However, the reasoning process was repetitive and did not evolve beyond the initial plan, which was effective but could be seen as a lack of creativity or adaptability in problem-solving.\n    answer_quality: 1.0\n    key_learnings:\n      - Directly searching for specific details like publication locations and publishers can be effective in verifying country of origin.\n      - Multiple verification points (author nationality and publication details) can strengthen the conclusion.\n      - The agent should avoid repeating the same search and reasoning process and consider exploring alternative sources or additional details to ensure a more comprehensive approach.\n  iteration: 12\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Yes\n    ground_truth:\n      - yes\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: True\n    subem_match: True\n  source_entry_labels:\n    - iter1_sol11\n  operator_name: reflection_refine\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\nRules:\n1. The answer in the previous attempt is WRONG \u2014 NEVER give that same answer again.\n2. The information that led to that wrong answer may also be wrong \u2014 do NOT trust it.\n3. Use DIFFERENT search queries than what was tried before. Search for each entity separately.\n4. Carefully check dates, names, and facts in the search results before concluding.\n5.
