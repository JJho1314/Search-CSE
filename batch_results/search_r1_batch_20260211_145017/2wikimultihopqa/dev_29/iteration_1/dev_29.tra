After reasoning, if you find you lack some knowledge, you can call a search engine by <search> query </search> and it will return the top searched results between <information> and </information>. You can search as many times as you want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Are Fire In Hell and The Tiger: An Old Hunter'S Tale from the same country?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  Use a dictionary to store the country of origin for each book. For each book title, look up its country of origin in the dictionary. This strategy leverages constant-time lookups for quick determination. The key data structures include a dictionary to map book titles to their respective countries. The expected time complexity is O(1) for each query, and the space complexity is O(N) where N is the number of unique books. This is efficient and optimal for the problem.\n"
