After reasoning, if you find you lack some knowledge, you can call a search engine by <search> query </search> and it will return the top searched results between <information> and </information>. You can search as many times as you want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Are Fire In Hell and The Tiger: An Old Hunter'S Tale from the same country?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  Implement a binary search tree (BST) where each node stores a book title and its country. Insert each book into the BST and then search for the second book in the tree. The BST allows for efficient insertion and lookup operations. The key data structures include a BST where each node contains a book title and its country. The time complexity for insertion and lookup is O(log N) on average, and the space complexity is O(N) for the BST. This method is efficient for dynamic datasets where insertions and deletions are frequent.\n"
