You can search as many times as you want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Where was the director of film Thomas Jefferson (Film) born?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  Greedy Algorithm: Implement a greedy algorithm that selects the most likely birthplace based on certain heuristics, such as the most common birthplaces for directors in the film industry. Continuously update the selection based on new information. This strategy provides a quick solution with O(n) time complexity, where n is the number of potential birthplaces, and O(1) space complexity as no additional data structures are used.\n",
