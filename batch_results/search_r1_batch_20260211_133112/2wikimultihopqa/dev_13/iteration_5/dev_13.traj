Then, it searched for Oliver Stone's birthplace, finding that he was born in San Francisco, California. The reasoning was logical, but the final answer did not match the ground truth, likely due to an error in the data source.\n    search_queries:\n      - <search>director of Thomas Jefferson (Film)</search>\n      - <search>oliver stone birthplace</search>\n    reasoning_quality: Logical reasoning with a backtracking approach.\n    answer_quality: The final answer was incorrect, as it did not match the provided ground truth.\n    key_learnings: It's important to verify the data source and ensure that the information found is accurate and relevant to the question.\n  iteration: 2\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: San Francisco, California\n    ground_truth:\n      - Brooklyn, New York\n      - Brooklyn\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: False\n    subem_match: False\n    failure_reason: Answer 'San Francisco, California' does not match any of ['Brooklyn, New York', 'Brooklyn']\n  source_entry_labels:\n\n  operator_name: plan\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\n### SYNTHESIS GUIDELINES\n1. **Combine Search Strategies**: Use the most effective search queries from both attempts. If T1 found relevant context about one aspect and T2 about another, combine both pieces of evidence.\n2. **Cross-validate Reasoning**: If both attempts reached different conclusions, use the search results from both to determine which reasoning chain is more supported by evidence.\n3. **Fill Knowledge Gaps**: If T1 missed a key fact that T2 found (or vice versa), ensure the combined approach uses all discovered information.\n4. **Avoid Shared Errors**: If both attempts made the same reasoning mistake, you MUST try a fundamentally different search approach or reasoning strategy for that part.\n5. **Produce Clean Answer**: The final answer should be a single, well-supported response inside <answer>...</answer> tags, backed by evidence from the combined search results.\n",
