After reasoning, if you find you lack some knowledge, you can call a search engine by <search> query </search> and it will return the top searched results between <information> and </information>. You can search as many times as you want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Where was the director of film Thomas Jefferson (Film) born?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  Backtracking: Use a backtracking algorithm to systematically explore all possible birthplaces for Thomas Jefferson. Start from a root node representing potential birthplaces and recursively explore all possible paths. Prune branches that do not lead to a valid solution. This strategy achieves O(n!) time complexity in the worst case and O(n) space complexity due to the call stack.\n"
