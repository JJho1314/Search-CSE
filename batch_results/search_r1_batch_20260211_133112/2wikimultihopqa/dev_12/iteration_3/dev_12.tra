After reasoning, if you find you lack some knowledge, you can call a search engine by <search> query </search> and it will return the top searched results between <information> and </information>. You can search as many times as you want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Which film has the director who died earlier, Il Seduttore or The Trial Of Joan Of Arc?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  Strategy 3: Hash Map\n  This strategy stores the directors' names and their corresponding death years in a hash map for quick lookups. The key data structure is the hash map. The expected time complexity is O(n) for constructing the hash map and O(1) for lookups, resulting in an overall time complexity of O(n). The space complexity is O(n) for storing the hash map.\n"
