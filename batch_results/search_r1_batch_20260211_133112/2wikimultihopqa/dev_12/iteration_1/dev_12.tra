After reasoning, if you find you lack some knowledge, you can call a search engine by <search> query </search> and it will return the top searched results between <information> and </information>. You can search as many times as you want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Which film has the director who died earlier, Il Seduttore or The Trial Of Joan Of Arc?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  Strategy 1: Binary Search\n  This strategy involves sorting the list of films by their directors' death years and then applying binary search to find the film directed by the director who died earlier. The key data structure is the sorted list of films. The expected time complexity is O(n log n) for sorting and O(log n) for binary search, resulting in an overall time complexity of O(n log n). The space complexity is O(n) for storing the sorted list.\n"
