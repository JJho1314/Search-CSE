However, the agent struggled with finding the correct death year of the director and the release dates of the films.\n    search_queries:\n      - <search>director of Tangled Destinies and The Daltons' Women</search>\n      - <search>George Marshall (director) death year</search>\n      - <search>Tangled Destinies and The Daltons' Women (1939)</search>\n      - <search>George Marshall (director) death year</search>\n    reasoning_quality: The reasoning chain was logical, but the agent missed connections with the death year of the director and the release dates of the films.\n    answer_quality: The final answer did not directly address the question, as the agent did not provide the correct title of the film.\n    key_learnings: For this type of question, it is important to ensure that the agent finds the correct death year of the director and the release dates of the films to provide a correct answer.\n  iteration: 4\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: ...\n    ground_truth:\n      - Tangled Destinies\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: False\n    subem_match: False\n    failure_reason: Answer '...' does not match any of ['Tangled Destinies']\n  source_entry_labels:\n    - sol2\n  operator_name: reflection_refine\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\n### REFINEMENT GUIDELINES\n1. **Diagnose Search Quality**: Review the search queries used. Did they target the right entities and relationships? Were they too broad or too narrow? Try more specific or alternative phrasings.\n2. **Check Information Extraction**: Did the search results contain the answer? If yes, identify where the agent failed to notice or use it. If no, the queries need to be reformulated.\n3. **Fix Reasoning Chain**: Trace the logic from search results to the final answer. Look for incorrect assumptions, confusion between similar entities, or missing logical steps.\n4. **Verify Answer Format**: Ensure the answer is placed inside <answer>...</answer> tags and is concise (e.g., a name, date, or short phrase — not a full sentence).\n5. **Try Different Angles**: If direct search failed, try searching for related entities, events, or alternative formulations of the question.\n"
