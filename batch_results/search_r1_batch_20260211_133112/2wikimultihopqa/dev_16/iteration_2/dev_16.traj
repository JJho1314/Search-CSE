For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Who died first, Fleetwood Sheppard or George William Whitaker?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  Another method is to retrieve historical data from a reliable source that contains the dates of death for both Fleetwood Sheppard and George William Whitaker. This can be done using a web scraping technique or by querying a database. The time complexity will depend on the size of the data source and the efficiency of the query, but it is likely to be efficient. The space complexity will be minimal as we only need to store the dates of death.\n",
