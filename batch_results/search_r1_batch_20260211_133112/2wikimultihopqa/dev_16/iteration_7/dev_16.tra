In December 1697, he was again reported as dead. In July 1698, he was \"\"again\"\" reported as dead. He did die shortly afterward, but in 1768 a joking \"\"Annual Register\"\" announced that Sheppard was still alive, in good health, and 120 years old. Fleetwood Sheppard Fleetwood Sheppard (sometimes spelled as \"\"Shepphard,\"\" \"\"Sheppheard,\"\" and \"\"Sheppeard\"\") (1 January 1634 \u2013 25 August 1698) was a British courtier and literary wit who was instrumental in the courts of Charles II of\n  Doc 2(Title: \"William Fleetwood Sheppard\") 11 in the evening. He retired in 1921 at the age of 58. To save money, the government had asked all civil servants who would be retiring in the next few years to retire immediately; this was part of the Geddes Axe. Sheppard could not afford to retire and so he took on work as an examiner for the Cambridge School Certificate and the University of London. This was a great burden because he was amazingly thorough, recording all the errors that were made and the marks given to ensure consistency of marking across thousands of scripts. Sheppard had a\n  Doc 3(Title: \"Kate Sheppard\") in England in 1915. Jennie Lovell-Smith died in 1924, and Sheppard and William Lovell-Smith married in 1925. Lovell-Smith died only four years later, and Sheppard herself died in Christchurch on 13 July 1934 at the age of 86. As her son Douglas had died of pernicious anaemia at the age of 29 in 1910, and her only grandchild, Margaret Isabel Sheppard, had died of tuberculosis at the age of 19 in 1930, Sheppard left no living direct descendants. She was buried at Addington Cemetery, Christchurch, in a grave with her mother and her brother Robert. Kate Sheppard is considered to</information>\n\n  <think>\n  1.

If T1 found relevant context about one aspect and T2 about another, combine both pieces of evidence.\n2. **Cross-validate Reasoning**: If both attempts reached different conclusions, use the search results from both to determine which reasoning chain is more supported by evidence.\n3. **Fill Knowledge Gaps**: If T1 missed a key fact that T2 found (or vice versa), ensure the combined approach uses all discovered information.\n4. **Avoid Shared Errors**: If both attempts made the same reasoning mistake, you MUST try a fundamentally different search approach or reasoning strategy for that part.\n5. **Produce Clean Answer**: The final answer should be a single, well-supported response inside <answer>...</answer> tags, backed by evidence from the combined search results.\n"
