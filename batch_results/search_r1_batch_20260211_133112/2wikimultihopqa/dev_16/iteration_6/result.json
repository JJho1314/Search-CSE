The only goal is correctness — producing an answer that exactly matches\nthe ground truth. Analyze why the previous attempt failed and fix it.\n\nCommon failure modes:\n- **Wrong Search Queries**: The queries did not find the relevant information needed to answer the question.\n- **Missed Key Information**: The search returned useful results but the agent failed to extract the critical fact.\n- **Reasoning Error**: The agent found relevant information but drew an incorrect conclusion.\n- **Format Error**: The agent knew the answer but did not format it correctly in <answer>...</answer> tags.\nIdentify which category applies, then focus your fix accordingly.\n\n### SOURCE TRAJECTORY SUMMARY\n  sol1\n  label: sol1\n  solution:\n  ```\n  <think>\n  I need to find out the dates of death for Fleetwood Sheppard and George William Whitaker.\n  </think>\n  <search>Who died first, Fleetwood Sheppard or George William Whitaker?</search>\n\n  <information>\n  Fleetwood Sheppard: Died on 15 September 1852\n  George William Whitaker: Died on 24 March 1846\n  </information>\n\n  <think>\n  Now I know the dates of death for both Fleetwood Sheppard and George William Whitaker.
