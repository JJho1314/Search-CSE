After reasoning, if you find you lack some knowledge, you can call a search engine by <search> query </search> and it will return the top searched results between <information> and </information>. You can search as many times as you want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Why did Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich Of Russia's wife die?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: REFLECTION AND REFINE STRATEGY\nYour previous attempt at answering a factual question using search and reasoning did not produce\nthe correct answer. The only goal is correctness \u2014 producing an answer that exactly matches\nthe ground truth. Analyze why the previous attempt failed and fix it.\n\nCommon failure modes:\n- **Wrong Search Queries**: The queries did not find the relevant information needed to answer the question.\n- **Missed Key Information**: The search returned useful results but the agent failed to extract the critical fact.\n- **Reasoning Error**: The agent found relevant information but drew an incorrect conclusion.\n- **Format Error**: The agent knew the answer but did not format it correctly in <answer>...</answer> tags.\nIdentify which category applies, then focus your fix accordingly.\n\n### SOURCE TRAJECTORY SUMMARY\n  sol5\n  label: sol5\n  solution:\n  ```\n  ### STRATEGY MODE: CROSSOVER STRATEGY\n  You are given two previous search-and-reasoning attempts at answering a factual question.\n  Neither produced the correct answer. Your task is to combine the best search strategies\n  and reasoning from both attempts to produce a correct answer.\n\n  Analyze each trajectory to understand:\n  - Which search queries found useful information and which did not\n  - What relevant facts each attempt discovered\n  - Where each attempt's reasoning went wrong\n  - Whether either attempt was close to the correct answer\n\n  ### TRAJECTORY 1 SUMMARY\n    sol4\n    label: sol4\n    solution:\n    ```\n    ### STRATEGY MODE: REFLECTION AND REFINE STRATEGY\n    Your previous attempt at answering a factual question using search and reasoning did not produce\n    the correct answer.

It focused on identifying relevant search queries, extracting key information, and reasoning logically across multiple steps. The agent successfully found the correct cause of death for Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich of Russia's wife, which was pneumonia.\n    search_queries:\n      - <search> Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich of Russia's wife </search>\n      - <search> Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine cause of death </search>\n      - <search> Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine pneumonia </search>\n    reasoning_quality: Logical and effective. The agent effectively connected the information found in multiple steps to reach the correct answer.\n    answer_quality: 1.0\n    key_learnings: Effective multi-hop reasoning is crucial for answering complex questions. Combining information from different search results and refining the search based on initial findings can lead to accurate answers.\n  iteration: 5\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: ...\n    ground_truth:\n      - embolic stroke\n      - stroke\n      - cerebrovascular accident\n      - CVA\n      - CVI\n      - Stroke\n      - brain attack\n      - cerebrovascular insult\n      - cerebrovascular disorder\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: False\n    subem_match: False\n    failure_reason: Answer '...' does not match any of ['embolic stroke', 'stroke', 'cerebrovascular accident', 'CVA', 'CVI', 'Stroke', 'brain attack', 'cerebrovascular insult', 'cerebrovascular disorder']\n  source_entry_labels:\n    - sol4\n    - sol2\n  operator_name: crossover\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\n### REFINEMENT GUIDELINES\n1. **Diagnose Search Quality**: Review the search queries used. Did they target the right entities and relationships? Were they too broad or too narrow? Try more specific or alternative phrasings.\n2. **Check Information Extraction**: Did the search results contain the answer? If yes, identify where the agent failed to notice or use it. If no, the queries need to be reformulated.\n3. **Fix Reasoning Chain**: Trace the logic from search results to the final answer. Look for incorrect assumptions, confusion between similar entities, or missing logical steps.\n4. **Verify Answer Format**: Ensure the answer is placed inside <answer>...</answer> tags and is concise (e.g., a name, date, or short phrase \u2014 not a full sentence).\n5. **Try Different Angles**: If direct search failed, try searching for related entities, events, or alternative formulations of the question.\n"
