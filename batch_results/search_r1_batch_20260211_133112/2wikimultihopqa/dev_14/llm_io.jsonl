Did they target the right entities and relationships? Were they too broad or too narrow? Try more specific or alternative phrasings.\\n2. **Check Information Extraction**: Did the search results contain the answer? If yes, identify where the agent failed to notice or use it. If no, the queries need to be reformulated.\\n3. **Fix Reasoning Chain**: Trace the logic from search results to the final answer. Look for incorrect assumptions, confusion between similar entities, or missing logical steps.\\n4. **Verify Answer Format**: Ensure the answer is placed inside <answer>...</answer> tags and is concise (e.g., a name, date, or short phrase \\u2014 not a full sentence).\\n5. **Try Different Angles**: If direct search failed, try searching for related entities, events, or alternative formulations of the question.\\n\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"## Previous Attempt Result\\n\\n- Status: \\u274c Incorrect\\n- Extracted answer: None\\n\\n## Your Previous Reasoning Trajectory\\n\\n\\n\\n## Instructions\\nYour previous answer was incorrect.
