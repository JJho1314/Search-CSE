For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Why did Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich Of Russia's wife die?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  Genetic Analysis: The second strategy employs advanced genetic analysis techniques to trace the possible genetic predispositions or inherited conditions that could have contributed to the Grand Duke's wife's demise. This strategy involves the use of bioinformatics tools for DNA sequencing, SNP analysis, and gene expression profiling. Key data structures include a HashMap for storing genetic data and a Binary Search Tree for efficient querying of genetic information. The expected Time Complexity is O(N log N) due to sorting and searching operations, where N is the number of genetic samples analyzed. Space Complexity is O(M), where M is the total number of genetic markers considered.\n"
