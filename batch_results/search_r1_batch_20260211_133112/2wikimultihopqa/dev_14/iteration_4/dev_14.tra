The agent effectively used the search engine to gather relevant information and chained the reasoning through multiple steps.\n    search_queries:\n      - <search> Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich of Russia's wife </search>\n      - <search> Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine cause of death </search>\n      - <search> Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine pneumonia </search>\n      - <search> Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine pneumonia details </search>\n    reasoning_quality: Logical and effective chaining of reasoning steps\n    answer_quality: The final answer 'pneumonia' directly addresses the question\n    key_learnings: Effective multi-hop reasoning can help in gathering and connecting pieces of information to solve complex questions. It is crucial to properly chain the reasoning and search queries to ensure all necessary information is found.\n  iteration: 1\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: pneumonia\n    ground_truth:\n      - embolic stroke\n      - stroke\n      - cerebrovascular accident\n      - CVA\n      - CVI\n      - Stroke\n      - brain attack\n      - cerebrovascular insult\n      - cerebrovascular disorder\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: False\n    subem_match: False\n    failure_reason: Answer 'pneumonia' does not match any of ['embolic stroke', 'stroke', 'cerebrovascular accident', 'CVA', 'CVI', 'Stroke', 'brain attack', 'cerebrovascular insult', 'cerebrovascular disorder']\n  source_entry_labels:\n\n  operator_name: plan\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\n### REFINEMENT GUIDELINES\n1. **Diagnose Search Quality**: Review the search queries used. Did they target the right entities and relationships? Were they too broad or too narrow? Try more specific or alternative phrasings.\n2. **Check Information Extraction**: Did the search results contain the answer? If yes, identify where the agent failed to notice or use it. If no, the queries need to be reformulated.\n3. **Fix Reasoning Chain**: Trace the logic from search results to the final answer. Look for incorrect assumptions, confusion between similar entities, or missing logical steps.\n4. **Verify Answer Format**: Ensure the answer is placed inside <answer>...</answer> tags and is concise (e.g., a name, date, or short phrase \u2014 not a full sentence).\n5. **Try Different Angles**: If direct search failed, try searching for related entities, events, or alternative formulations of the question.\n"
