For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Why did Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich Of Russia's wife die?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  Analyzing Historical Records: The first strategy involves a meticulous examination of historical records, personal diaries, and contemporary news articles. This approach leverages textual data analysis techniques to identify patterns, events, and key figures that might have influenced the Grand Duke's wife's health. The core logic includes keyword extraction, sentiment analysis, and event timeline reconstruction. The primary data structure used is a Trie for efficient keyword search, and a Graph for representing the relationships between historical events and their potential impact. The expected Time Complexity is O(N log N) due to sorting and searching operations, where N is the number of historical records. Space Complexity is O(M), where M is the total number of unique keywords identified.\n"
