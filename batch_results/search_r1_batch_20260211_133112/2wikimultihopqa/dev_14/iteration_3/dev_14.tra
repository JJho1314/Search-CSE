For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Why did Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich Of Russia's wife die?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  Social Network Analysis: The third strategy focuses on constructing a social network of the Grand Duke's wife's life, including her family, friends, and acquaintances. This approach utilizes graph theory to analyze the relationships and interactions that might have had an impact on her health. The core logic involves identifying influential individuals, detecting communities, and measuring centrality. The primary data structure used is an Adjacency List for efficient graph traversal and analysis. The expected Time Complexity is O(E + V), where E is the number of edges (interactions) and V is the number of vertices (individuals). Space Complexity is O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.\n"
