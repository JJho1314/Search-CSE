After reasoning, if you find you lack some knowledge, you can call a search engine by <search> query </search> and it will return the top searched results between <information> and </information>. You can search as many times as you want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Which film has the director born first, The Raven'S Dance or Keïta! L'Héritage Du Griot?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: REFLECTION AND REFINE STRATEGY\nYour previous attempt at answering a factual question using search and reasoning did not produce\nthe correct answer. The only goal is correctness — producing an answer that exactly matches\nthe ground truth. Analyze why the previous attempt failed and fix it.\n\nCommon failure modes:\n- **Wrong Search Queries**: The queries did not find the relevant information needed to answer the question.\n- **Missed Key Information**: The search returned useful results but the agent failed to extract the critical fact.\n- **Reasoning Error**: The agent found relevant information but drew an incorrect conclusion.\n- **Format Error**: The agent knew the answer but did not format it correctly in <answer>...</answer> tags.\nIdentify which category applies, then focus your fix accordingly.\n\n### SOURCE TRAJECTORY SUMMARY\n  sol7\n  label: sol7\n  solution:\n  ```\n  <think>\n  - The question asks which film has the director born first, \"The Raven's Dance\" or \"Keïta!

L'Héritage Du Griot</answer>\n  ```\n  metric: 0.0\n  summary:\n    solution_name: multi_hop_v2\n    approach_summary: The agent used a multi-hop search strategy, initially identifying the directors of both films, then searching for their birth years to determine who was born first. Finally, it identified the film directed by the oldest director.\n    search_queries:\n      - <search>director of The Raven's Dance and director of Keïta! L'Héritage Du Griot</search>\n      - <search>Na Hong-jin birth year and Idrissa Ouedraogo birth year</search>\n      - <search>Idrissa Ouedraogo's film</search>\n    reasoning_quality: Logical and well-structured. The agent effectively broke down the problem into smaller steps and used the gathered information to make deductions.\n    answer_quality: Correct. The agent correctly identified the film directed by the director born first.\n    key_learnings: Effective multi-hop search strategies can help in solving complex problems by breaking them down into manageable parts. It is also crucial to use the gathered information to make logical deductions.\n  iteration: 7\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Keïta! L'Héritage Du Griot\n    ground_truth:\n      - The Raven's Dance\n      - Raven's Dance\n      - The Raven'S Dance\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: False\n    subem_match: False\n    failure_reason: Answer 'Keïta!

Did they target the right entities and relationships? Were they too broad or too narrow? Try more specific or alternative phrasings.\n2. **Check Information Extraction**: Did the search results contain the answer? If yes, identify where the agent failed to notice or use it. If no, the queries need to be reformulated.\n3. **Fix Reasoning Chain**: Trace the logic from search results to the final answer. Look for incorrect assumptions, confusion between similar entities, or missing logical steps.\n4. **Verify Answer Format**: Ensure the answer is placed inside <answer>...</answer> tags and is concise (e.g., a name, date, or short phrase — not a full sentence).\n5. **Try Different Angles**: If direct search failed, try searching for related entities, events, or alternative formulations of the question.\n",
