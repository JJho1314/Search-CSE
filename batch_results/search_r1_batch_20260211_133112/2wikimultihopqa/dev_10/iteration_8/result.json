  "solution": "### STRATEGY MODE: REFLECTION AND REFINE STRATEGY\nYour previous attempt at answering the question \"Which film has the director died first, Crimen A Las Tres or The Working Class Goes To Heaven?\" was incorrect. The main failure was in not correctly identifying the death dates of the directors of both films. Since the death date of Juan José Campanella wasn't mentioned, the agent incorrectly assumed he was still alive and thus Crimen A Las Tres was the correct answer. To fix this, we need to ensure we check for the death dates of both directors and compare them accurately.\n\n### SOURCE TRAJECTORY SUMMARY\n  sol1\n  label: sol1\n  solution:\n  ```\n  <think>\n  1. The question asks for the film directed by the first deceased director.\n  2. I need to know the directors of both films and their death dates.\n  </think>\n  <search>director of Crimen A Las Tres, director of The Working Class Goes To Heaven</search>\n\n  <information>\n  1. Crimen A Las Tres: Directed by Agustín Martín Jáuregui\n  2. The Working Class Goes To Heaven: Directed by Juan José Campanella\n  </information>\n\n  <think>\n  1. I need to find out which director died first.\n  </think>\n  <search>death date of Agustín Martín Jáuregui, death date of Juan José Campanella</search>\n\n  <information>\n  1. Agustín Martín Jáuregui: died on December 2, 2016\n  2. Juan José Campanella: born April 19, 1973 (no death date mentioned)\n  </information>\n\n  <think>\n  1. I need to find out if Juan José Campanella's death date is known.\n  </think>\n  <search>death date of Juan José Campanella</search>\n\n  <information>\n  1. No death date is mentioned for Juan José Campanella.\n  </information>\n\n  <think>\n  1. Since Juan José Campanella's death date is unknown, I can conclude that Agustín Martín Jáuregui died before Juan José Campanella, if he has died.\n  </think>\n  <answer> Crimen A Las Tres </answer>",
