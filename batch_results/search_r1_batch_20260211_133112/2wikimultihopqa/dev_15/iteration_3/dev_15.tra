You can search as many times as you want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Where was the place of death of the director of film Beat Girl?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  Dynamic Programming is utilized to build a matrix where each cell represents the best possible solution for a subproblem. By iteratively filling this matrix, we determine the optimal location of death for the director of 'Beat Girl'. The expected time complexity is O(V^2) and the space complexity is O(V) where V is the number of locations.\n"
