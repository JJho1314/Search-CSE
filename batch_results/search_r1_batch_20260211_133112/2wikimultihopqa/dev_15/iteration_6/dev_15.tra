      "content": "Answer the given question. You must conduct reasoning inside <think> and </think> first every time you get new information. After reasoning, if you find you lack some knowledge, you can call a search engine by <search> query </search> and it will return the top searched results between <information> and </information>. You can search as many times as you want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Where was the place of death of the director of film Beat Girl?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: REFLECTION AND REFINE STRATEGY\nYour previous attempt at answering a factual question using search and reasoning did not produce\nthe correct answer. The only goal is correctness \u2014 producing an answer that exactly matches\nthe ground truth. Analyze why the previous attempt failed and fix it.\n\nCommon failure modes:\n- **Wrong Search Queries**: The queries did not find the relevant information needed to answer the question.\n- **Missed Key Information**: The search returned useful results but the agent failed to extract the critical fact.\n- **Reasoning Error**: The agent found relevant information but drew an incorrect conclusion.\n- **Format Error**: The agent knew the answer but did not format it correctly in <answer>...</answer> tags.\nIdentify which category applies, then focus your fix accordingly.\n\n### SOURCE TRAJECTORY SUMMARY\n  sol5\n  label: sol5\n  solution:\n  ```\n  <think>\n  1. The question asks for the place of death of the director of the film \"Beat Girl.\"\n  2. I need to find out who the director of \"Beat Girl\" is.\n  </think>\n  <search>director of Beat Girl</search>\n\n  <information>\n  - \"Beat Girl\" is a 1968 Italian film directed by Fernando Di Leo.\n  </information>\n\n  <think>\n  1. I now know the director of \"Beat Girl\" is Fernando Di Leo.\n  2. I need to find out where Fernando Di Leo died.\n  </think>\n  <search>death place of Fernando Di Leo</search>\n\n  <information>\n  - Fernando Di Leo was an Italian film director who died in Rome, Italy.\n  </information>\n\n  <think>\n  1. I have found out that the director of \"Beat Girl,\" Fernando Di Leo, died in Rome, Italy.\n  </think>\n  <answer>Rome, Italy</answer>\n  ```\n  metric: 0.0\n  summary:\n    solution_name: direct_search\n    approach_summary: The agent combined a direct search approach from the second attempt to find the director of 'Beat Girl' and a multi-hop strategy from the first attempt to find the place of death of the director. The agent effectively searched for the director and then focused on finding the place of death, resulting in a correct answer.\n    search_queries:\n      - <search>director of Beat Girl</search>\n      - <search>death place of Fernando Di Leo</search>\n    reasoning_quality: Logical and complete reasoning chain. The agent successfully connected the information from the first search to the second one.\n    answer_quality: The final answer 'Rome, Italy' directly addresses the question and is correct.\n    key_learnings: For this type of question, it's effective to first identify the subject of interest (director in this case) and then search for the specific information required (place of death).\n  iteration: 5\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Rome, Italy\n    ground_truth:\n      - Nice\n      - Nizza\n      - Nice, France\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: False\n    subem_match: False\n    failure_reason: Answer 'Rome, Italy' does not match any of ['Nice', 'Nizza', 'Nice, France']\n  source_entry_labels:\n    - sol2\n    - sol3\n  operator_name: crossover\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\n### REFINEMENT GUIDELINES\n1. **Diagnose Search Quality**: Review the search queries used. Did they target the right entities and relationships? Were they too broad or too narrow? Try more specific or alternative phrasings.\n2. **Check Information Extraction**: Did the search results contain the answer? If yes, identify where the agent failed to notice or use it. If no, the queries need to be reformulated.\n3. **Fix Reasoning Chain**: Trace the logic from search results to the final answer. Look for incorrect assumptions, confusion between similar entities, or missing logical steps.\n4. **Verify Answer Format**: Ensure the answer is placed inside <answer>...</answer> tags and is concise (e.g., a name, date, or short phrase \u2014 not a full sentence).\n5. **Try Different Angles**: If direct search failed, try searching for related entities, events, or alternative formulations of the question.\n"
