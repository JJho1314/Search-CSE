After reasoning, if you find you lack some knowledge, you can call a search engine by <search> query </search> and it will return the top searched results between <information> and </information>. You can search as many times as you want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Where was the place of death of the director of film Beat Girl?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: CROSSOVER STRATEGY\nYou are given two previous search-and-reasoning attempts at answering a factual question.\nNeither produced the correct answer. Your task is to combine the best search strategies\nand reasoning from both attempts to produce a correct answer.\n\nAnalyze each trajectory to understand:\n- Which search queries found useful information and which did not\n- What relevant facts each attempt discovered\n- Where each attempt's reasoning went wrong\n- Whether either attempt was close to the correct answer\n\n### TRAJECTORY 1 SUMMARY\n  sol2\n  label: sol2\n  solution:\n  ```\n  <think>\n  1.

The question asks for the place of death of the director of the film 'Beat Girl'.\n  2. I need to find the director of 'Beat Girl' first.\n  </think>\n  <search>director of Beat Girl</search>\n\n  <information>\n  - Beat Girl (1960) is a French film directed by Jean-Pierre Melville.\n  </information>\n\n  <think>\n  1.

The reasoning was logical and sequential.\n    search_queries:\n      -\n        query: director of Beat Girl\n        effectiveness: Effective - found Jean-Pierre Melville\n      -\n        query: place of death of Jean-Pierre Melville\n        effectiveness: Effective - found Neuilly-sur-Seine, France\n    reasoning_quality: Logical and sequential\n    answer_quality: The final answer directly addresses the question.\n    key_learnings: For this type of question, it's effective to first identify the subject of interest (director in this case) and then search for the specific information required (place of death).\n  iteration: 3\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Neuilly-sur-Seine, France\n    ground_truth:\n      - Nice\n      - Nizza\n      - Nice, France\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: False\n    subem_match: False\n    failure_reason: Answer 'Neuilly-sur-Seine, France' does not match any of ['Nice', 'Nizza', 'Nice, France']\n  source_entry_labels:\n\n  operator_name: plan\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\n### SYNTHESIS GUIDELINES\n1. **Combine Search Strategies**: Use the most effective search queries from both attempts. If T1 found relevant context about one aspect and T2 about another, combine both pieces of evidence.\n2. **Cross-validate Reasoning**: If both attempts reached different conclusions, use the search results from both to determine which reasoning chain is more supported by evidence.\n3. **Fill Knowledge Gaps**: If T1 missed a key fact that T2 found (or vice versa), ensure the combined approach uses all discovered information.\n4. **Avoid Shared Errors**: If both attempts made the same reasoning mistake, you MUST try a fundamentally different search approach or reasoning strategy for that part.\n5. **Produce Clean Answer**: The final answer should be a single, well-supported response inside <answer>...</answer> tags, backed by evidence from the combined search results.\n"
