After reasoning, if you find you lack some knowledge, you can call a search engine by <search> query </search> and it will return the top searched results between <information> and </information>. You can search as many times as you want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: When did Jean Martin (Singer)'s husband die?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: CROSSOVER STRATEGY\nYou are given two previous search-and-reasoning attempts at answering a factual question.\nNeither produced the correct answer. Your task is to combine the best search strategies\nand reasoning from both attempts to produce a correct answer.\n\nAnalyze each trajectory to understand:\n- Which search queries found useful information and which did not\n- What relevant facts each attempt discovered\n- Where each attempt's reasoning went wrong\n- Whether either attempt was close to the correct answer\n\n### TRAJECTORY 1 SUMMARY\n  sol3\n  label: sol3\n  solution:\n  ```\n  <think>\n  1. The question asks for the time of Jean Martin's husband's death.\n  2.

The agent successfully identified the husband's name and then searched for the time of his death.\n    answer_quality: The final answer directly addresses the question. The agent provided the correct answer, January 26, 1964.\n    key_learnings: For this type of question, it is important to break down the question into smaller parts and search for information step by step.

The question asks for the time when Jean Martin's husband died.\n  2. I need to find out who Jean Martin's husband was and when he died.\n  </think>\n  <search>Jean Martin (Singer) husband</search>\n\n  ### Search Results:\n  - Jean Martin is a singer known for her work in French music.\n  - Jean Martin's husband is Michel Delpech.\n  - Michel Delpech was a French singer and actor.\n\n  <think>\n  1.

The agent effectively used sequential information to find the answer.\n    answer_quality: Correct. The final answer directly addresses the question and matches the ground truth.\n    key_learnings: For this type of question, a multi-hop search approach is effective when the direct answer isn't immediately available.

If T1 found relevant context about one aspect and T2 about another, combine both pieces of evidence.\n2. **Cross-validate Reasoning**: If both attempts reached different conclusions, use the search results from both to determine which reasoning chain is more supported by evidence.\n3. **Fill Knowledge Gaps**: If T1 missed a key fact that T2 found (or vice versa), ensure the combined approach uses all discovered information.\n4. **Avoid Shared Errors**: If both attempts made the same reasoning mistake, you MUST try a fundamentally different search approach or reasoning strategy for that part.\n5. **Produce Clean Answer**: The final answer should be a single, well-supported response inside <answer>...</answer> tags, backed by evidence from the combined search results.\n"
