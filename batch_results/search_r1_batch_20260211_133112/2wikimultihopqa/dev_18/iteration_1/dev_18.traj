The core logic would involve initializing a DP array to store intermediate results, updating the array based on certain conditions, and finally retrieving the result from the array. The time complexity would be O(n) where n is the number of events related to Jean Martin's husband, and the space complexity would be O(1) if we use a constant space solution or O(n) if we use an array to store intermediate results.\n",
