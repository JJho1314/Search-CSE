The approach would involve iterating through the events and making the locally optimal choice at each step, which would lead to a globally optimal solution. The time complexity would be O(n log n) due to sorting the events, and the space complexity would be O(1) if we use a constant space solution or O(n) if we use an array to store the events.\n",
