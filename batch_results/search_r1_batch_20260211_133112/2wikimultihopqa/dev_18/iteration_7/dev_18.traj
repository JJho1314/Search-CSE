You can search as many times as you want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: When did Jean Martin (Singer)'s husband die?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: CROSSOVER STRATEGY\nYou are given two previous search-and-reasoning attempts at answering a factual question.\nNeither produced the correct answer. Your task is to combine the best search strategies\nand reasoning from both attempts to produce a correct answer.\n\nAnalyze each trajectory to understand:\n- Which search queries found useful information and which did not\n- What relevant facts each attempt discovered\n- Where each attempt's reasoning went wrong\n- Whether either attempt was close to the correct answer\n\n### TRAJECTORY 1 SUMMARY\n  sol1\n  label: sol1\n  solution:\n  ```\n  <think>\n  1.

The agent effectively used sequential information to find the answer.\n    answer_quality: Correct. The final answer directly addresses the question and matches the ground truth.\n    key_learnings: For this type of question, a multi-hop search approach is effective when the direct answer isn't immediately available.

I need to find information about Jean Martin (Singer) and her husband.\n  2. I need to know the time of her husband's death.\n  </think>\n  <search>When did Jean Martin's (Singer) husband die?</search>\n\n  <information>\n  Jean Martin (Singer), also known as Jean Martin, was a singer from France. She was married to Pierre Martin, who was a producer and manager. Pierre Martin died on December 22, 1996.\n  </information>\n\n  <think>\n  1. I need to find out the time of Jean Martin's husband, Pierre Martin, death.\n  </think>\n  <search>When did Pierre Martin die?</search>\n\n  <answer>December 22, 1996</answer>\n  ```\n  metric: 0.0\n  summary:\n    solution_name: multi_hop_v2\n    approach_summary: The agent employed a multi-hop search strategy to find information about Jean Martin (Singer) and her husband. Initially, the agent searched for 'When did Jean Martin's (Singer) husband die?' and found information about Pierre Martin's death. Then, the agent searched for 'When did Pierre Martin die?' to obtain the specific date. The reasoning was logical and effective in finding the answer.\n    search_queries:\n      - <search>When did Jean Martin's (Singer) husband die?</search>\n      - <search>When did Pierre Martin die?</search>\n    reasoning_quality: logical\n    answer_quality: direct\n    key_learnings: Effective search strategies involve breaking down the question into smaller parts and searching for each part sequentially. This allows for a more focused search and a clearer path to finding the answer.\n  iteration: 2\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: December 22, 1996\n    ground_truth:\n      - 1983\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: False\n    subem_match: False\n    failure_reason: Answer 'December 22, 1996' does not match any of ['1983']\n  source_entry_labels:\n\n  operator_name: plan\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\n### SYNTHESIS GUIDELINES\n1. **Combine Search Strategies**: Use the most effective search queries from both attempts. If T1 found relevant context about one aspect and T2 about another, combine both pieces of evidence.\n2. **Cross-validate Reasoning**: If both attempts reached different conclusions, use the search results from both to determine which reasoning chain is more supported by evidence.\n3. **Fill Knowledge Gaps**: If T1 missed a key fact that T2 found (or vice versa), ensure the combined approach uses all discovered information.\n4. **Avoid Shared Errors**: If both attempts made the same reasoning mistake, you MUST try a fundamentally different search approach or reasoning strategy for that part.\n5. **Produce Clean Answer**: The final answer should be a single, well-supported response inside <answer>...</answer> tags, backed by evidence from the combined search results.\n",
