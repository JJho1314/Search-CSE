The reasoning was straightforward and based on the information retrieved from the search results.\n    search_queries:\n      - <search>director of World And Time Enough</search>\n      - <search>nationality of Christopher McQuarrie</search>\n    reasoning_quality: Logical and effective. The agent's reasoning chain was straightforward and directly addressed the question by finding the director and then verifying their nationality.\n    answer_quality: Correct. The final answer 'American' directly addresses the question and matches the ground truth.\n    key_learnings: For this type of question, a direct search approach using relevant keywords and following the reasoning steps can be very effective in finding accurate answers. It's also important to verify the nationality of the director, as the initial search result may not directly provide the answer.\n  iteration: 5\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: American\n    ground_truth:\n      - U.S.A.\n      - US of A\n      - US\n      - United States of America\n      - USA\n      - the United States of America\n      - United States\n      - the US\n      - \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\n      - the United States\n      - U.S.\n      - America\n      - the USA\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: False\n    subem_match: True\n    failure_reason: Answer 'American' does not match any of ['U.S.A.', 'US of A', 'US', 'United States of America', 'USA', 'the United States of America', 'United States', 'the US', '\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8', 'the United States', 'U.S.', 'America', 'the USA']\n  source_entry_labels:\n\n  operator_name: plan\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\n### REFINEMENT GUIDELINES\n1. **Diagnose Search Quality**: Review the search queries used. Did they target the right entities and relationships? Were they too broad or too narrow? Try more specific or alternative phrasings.\n2. **Check Information Extraction**: Did the search results contain the answer? If yes, identify where the agent failed to notice or use it. If no, the queries need to be reformulated.\n3. **Fix Reasoning Chain**: Trace the logic from search results to the final answer. Look for incorrect assumptions, confusion between similar entities, or missing logical steps.\n4. **Verify Answer Format**: Ensure the answer is placed inside <answer>...</answer> tags and is concise (e.g., a name, date, or short phrase \u2014 not a full sentence).\n5. **Try Different Angles**: If direct search failed, try searching for related entities, events, or alternative formulations of the question.\n"
