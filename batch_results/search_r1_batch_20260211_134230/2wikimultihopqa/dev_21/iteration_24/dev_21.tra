After finding out that the director is Anne Fontaine, the agent then searched for Anne Fontaine's nationality. This multi-hop approach effectively led to the correct answer, 'French'.\n    search_queries:\n      - <search> director of the film World And Time Enough </search>\n      - <search> nationality of Anne Fontaine </search>\n    reasoning_quality: Logical and straightforward. The reasoning chain clearly follows the steps of identifying the director and then finding their nationality.\n    answer_quality: True\n    key_learnings: For questions about film directors and their nationalities, starting with a basic search for the director and then searching for their nationality can be an effective strategy. This approach ensures that all necessary information is found and leads to an accurate answer.\n  iteration: 18\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: ...\n    ground_truth:\n      - U.S.A.\n      - US of A\n      - US\n      - United States of America\n      - USA\n      - the United States of America\n      - United States\n      - the US\n      - \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\n      - the United States\n      - U.S.\n      - America\n      - the USA\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: False\n    subem_match: False\n    failure_reason: Answer '...' does not match any of ['U.S.A.', 'US of A', 'US', 'United States of America', 'USA', 'the United States of America', 'United States', 'the US', '\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8', 'the United States', 'U.S.', 'America', 'the USA']\n  source_entry_labels:\n    - iter1_sol14\n  operator_name: reflection_refine\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\n### REFINEMENT GUIDELINES\n1. **Diagnose Search Quality**: Review the search queries used. Did they target the right entities and relationships? Were they too broad or too narrow? Try more specific or alternative phrasings.\n2. **Check Information Extraction**: Did the search results contain the answer? If yes, identify where the agent failed to notice or use it. If no, the queries need to be reformulated.\n3. **Fix Reasoning Chain**: Trace the logic from search results to the final answer. Look for incorrect assumptions, confusion between similar entities, or missing logical steps.\n4. **Verify Answer Format**: Ensure the answer is placed inside <answer>...</answer> tags and is concise (e.g., a name, date, or short phrase \u2014 not a full sentence).\n5. **Try Different Angles**: If direct search failed, try searching for related entities, events, or alternative formulations of the question.\n"
