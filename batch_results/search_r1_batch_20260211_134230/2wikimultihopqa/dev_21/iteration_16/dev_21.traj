The reasoning is logical and the agent successfully finds the correct answer.\n    search_queries:\n      -\n        query: director of the film World and Time Enough\n        effectiveness: Effective as it directly leads to the name of the director, Roger Christian.\n      -\n        query: nationality of Roger Christian\n        effectiveness: Effective as it directly provides the nationality, British.\n    reasoning_quality: Logical and direct. The agent efficiently moves from finding the director to finding the nationality.\n    answer_quality: Correct. The final answer 'British' directly addresses the question.\n    key_learnings: For this type of question, a sequential search approach focusing on key details like the director and then their nationality is effective.\n  iteration: 1\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: British\n    ground_truth:\n      - U.S.A.\n      - US of A\n      - US\n      - United States of America\n      - USA\n      - the United States of America\n      - United States\n      - the US\n      - 🇺🇸\n      - the United States\n      - U.S.\n      - America\n      - the USA\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: False\n    subem_match: False\n    failure_reason: Answer 'British' does not match any of ['U.S.A.', 'US of A', 'US', 'United States of America', 'USA', 'the United States of America', 'United States', 'the US', '🇺🇸', 'the United States', 'U.S.', 'America', 'the USA']\n  source_entry_labels:\n\n  operator_name: plan\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\n### REFINEMENT GUIDELINES\n1. **Diagnose Search Quality**: Review the search queries used. Did they target the right entities and relationships? Were they too broad or too narrow? Try more specific or alternative phrasings.\n2. **Check Information Extraction**: Did the search results contain the answer? If yes, identify where the agent failed to notice or use it. If no, the queries need to be reformulated.\n3. **Fix Reasoning Chain**: Trace the logic from search results to the final answer. Look for incorrect assumptions, confusion between similar entities, or missing logical steps.\n4. **Verify Answer Format**: Ensure the answer is placed inside <answer>...</answer> tags and is concise (e.g., a name, date, or short phrase — not a full sentence).\n5. **Try Different Angles**: If direct search failed, try searching for related entities, events, or alternative formulations of the question.\n",
