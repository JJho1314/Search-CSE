You can search as many times as you want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: What nationality is the director of film World And Time Enough?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  Implement a BFS (Breadth-First Search) strategy starting from all possible starting points and exploring neighboring paths to find the shortest path to the goal. Use a queue to manage nodes to be visited. The time complexity is O(V+E) where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges, and the space complexity is O(V) for the queue and visited set.\n"
