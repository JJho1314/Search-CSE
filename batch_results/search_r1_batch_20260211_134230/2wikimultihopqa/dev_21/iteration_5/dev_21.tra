For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: What nationality is the director of film World And Time Enough?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  Use Bit Manipulation to efficiently handle binary representations or flags. This can be particularly useful for problems involving subsets or combinations. The time complexity is often O(2^n) for generating all subsets, but optimizations can reduce it. The space complexity is O(1) for operations on individual bits, but O(n) for storing all subsets.\n"
