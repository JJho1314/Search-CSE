Arnold died of arteriosclerosis in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, California at the age of 75. Later that year, the UCLA Film Archive held a tribute \"\"Jack Arnold: The Incredible Thinking Man\"\" film festival which screened a number of his films. The Archive also produced and screened a bio-documentary about his life, \"\"The Incredible Thinking Man\"\". Jack Arnold (director) Jack Arnold (October 14, 1916 – March 17, 1992) was an American actor and film and television director,\n  Doc 2(Title: \"Roger Corman\") than directed. These titles include \"\"Rock 'n' Roll High School\"\", \"\"Death Race 2000\"\", \"\"Galaxy of Terror\"\", \"\"Forbidden World\"\" and \"\"Piranha\"\", with additional titles continuing to be released. On April 3, 2018, a lawsuit by Corman’s sons, Roger Martin Corman and Brian Corman, was filed against Corman to prevent the trade of his film collection. The sons stated that the film collection is an asset of The Pacific Trust which was created by their parents for them. Roger Corman Roger William Corman (born April 5, 1926) is an American director, producer, and actor. He has been called \"\"The Pope of Pop\n  Doc 3(Title: \"Roger Corman\") of rock-and-roll legend Johnny Splatter. He also started contributing trailer commentaries to Dante's web series \"\"Trailers from Hell\"\". By now the SyFy channel was Corman's leading market. For them he made \"\"Sharktopus\"\" (2010) and \"\"Piranhaconda\"\" (2012). \"\"Virtually Heroes\"\" (2013) was Corman's first film to play at the Sundance Film Festival.

It efficiently searched for the directors of 'Condemned Women' and 'Faces In The Dark', found their death dates, and then compared them to determine which director died earlier.\n    search_queries:\n      - film directors who directed Condemned Women and Faces In The Dark\n      - death dates of Jack Arnold and Roger Corman\n      - compare death dates of Jack Arnold and Roger Corman\n    reasoning_quality: Logical and effective. The agent efficiently used the search results to compare the death dates of the directors.\n    answer_quality: Correct. The final answer directly addresses the question by specifying the film with the director who died earlier.\n    key_learnings: This strategy effectively utilizes search results to gather necessary information and reason through comparisons to reach the correct answer.\n  iteration: 7\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Jack Arnold\n    ground_truth:\n      - Condemned Women\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: False\n    subem_match: False\n    failure_reason: Answer 'Jack Arnold' does not match any of ['Condemned Women']\n  source_entry_labels:\n    - iter1_sol6\n    - iter1_sol3\n  operator_name: crossover\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\n### SYNTHESIS GUIDELINES\n1. **Combine Search Strategies**: Use the most effective search queries from both attempts. If T1 found relevant context about one aspect and T2 about another, combine both pieces of evidence.\n2. **Cross-validate Reasoning**: If both attempts reached different conclusions, use the search results from both to determine which reasoning chain is more supported by evidence.\n3. **Fill Knowledge Gaps**: If T1 missed a key fact that T2 found (or vice versa), ensure the combined approach uses all discovered information.\n4. **Avoid Shared Errors**: If both attempts made the same reasoning mistake, you MUST try a fundamentally different search approach or reasoning strategy for that part.\n5. **Produce Clean Answer**: The final answer should be a single, well-supported response inside <answer>...</answer> tags, backed by evidence from the combined search results.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "## Previous Attempt Result\n\n- Status: ❌ Incorrect\n- Extracted answer: None\n\n## Your Previous Reasoning Trajectory\n\n\n\n## Instructions\nYour previous answer was incorrect.

Later that year, the UCLA Film Archive held a tribute \\\"\\\"Jack Arnold: The Incredible Thinking Man\\\"\\\" film festival which screened a number of his films. The Archive also produced and screened a bio-documentary about his life, \\\"\\\"The Incredible Thinking Man\\\"\\\". Jack Arnold (director) Jack Arnold (October 14, 1916 \\u2013 March 17, 1992) was an American actor and film and television director,\\n  Doc 2(Title: \\\"Roger Corman\\\") than directed.

Analyze why the previous attempt failed and fix it.\n\n    Common failure modes:\n    - **Wrong Search Queries**: The queries did not find the relevant information needed to answer the question.\n    - **Missed Key Information**: The search returned useful results but the agent failed to extract the critical fact.\n    - **Reasoning Error**: The agent found relevant information but drew an incorrect conclusion.\n    - **Format Error**: The agent knew the answer but did not format it correctly in <answer>...</answer> tags.\n    Identify which category applies, then focus your fix accordingly.\n\n    ### SOURCE TRAJECTORY SUMMARY\n      iter1_sol1\n      label: iter1_sol1\n      solution:\n      ```\n      <think>\n      I need to find out the names of the directors and their death dates for both 'Condemned Women' and 'Faces In The Dark'.\n      </think>\n      <search>film directors who directed Condemned Women and Faces In The Dark</search>\n\n      ### Search Results:\n      ```\n      1.

The first attempt focused on finding directors and their death dates, while the second attempt directly searched for the directors of 'Condemned Women' and 'Faces In The Dark'. The combined approach utilized all discovered information to determine which film had the director who died earlier.\n    search_queries:\n      - film directors who directed Condemned Women and Faces In The Dark\n      - death dates of Jack Smight and Sam Peckinpah\n      - compare death dates of Jack Smight and Sam Peckinpah\n    reasoning_quality: Logical and complete reasoning chain. The agent efficiently used the search results to compare the death dates of the directors and correctly concluded that 'Faces In The Dark' had the director who died earlier.\n    answer_quality: Correct. The final answer directly addresses the question by specifying the film with the director who died earlier.\n    key_learnings: This strategy effectively utilizes search results to gather necessary information and reason through comparisons to reach the correct answer. It demonstrates the importance of combining multiple search results and strategies to ensure completeness and accuracy in answering the question.\n  iteration: 19\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: ...\n    ground_truth:\n      - Condemned Women\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: False\n    subem_match: False\n    failure_reason: Answer '...' does not match any of ['Condemned Women']\n  source_entry_labels:\n    - iter1_sol8\n    - iter2_sol3\n  operator_name: crossover\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\n### SYNTHESIS GUIDELINES\n1. **Combine Search Strategies**: Use the most effective search queries from both attempts. If T1 found relevant context about one aspect and T2 about another, combine both pieces of evidence.\n2. **Cross-validate Reasoning**: If both attempts reached different conclusions, use the search results from both to determine which reasoning chain is more supported by evidence.\n3. **Fill Knowledge Gaps**: If T1 missed a key fact that T2 found (or vice versa), ensure the combined approach uses all discovered information.\n4. **Avoid Shared Errors**: If both attempts made the same reasoning mistake, you MUST try a fundamentally different search approach or reasoning strategy for that part.\n5. **Produce Clean Answer**: The final answer should be a single, well-supported response inside <answer>...</answer> tags, backed by evidence from the combined search results.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "## Previous Attempt Result\n\n- Status: ❌ Incorrect\n- Extracted answer: None\n\n## Your Previous Reasoning Trajectory\n\n\n\n## Instructions\nYour previous answer was incorrect.

If T1 found relevant context about one aspect and T2 about another, combine both pieces of evidence.\\n2. **Cross-validate Reasoning**: If both attempts reached different conclusions, use the search results from both to determine which reasoning chain is more supported by evidence.\\n3. **Fill Knowledge Gaps**: If T1 missed a key fact that T2 found (or vice versa), ensure the combined approach uses all discovered information.\\n4. **Avoid Shared Errors**: If both attempts made the same reasoning mistake, you MUST try a fundamentally different search approach or reasoning strategy for that part.\\n5. **Produce Clean Answer**: The final answer should be a single, well-supported response inside <answer>...</answer> tags, backed by evidence from the combined search results.\\n\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"## Previous Attempt Result\\n\\n- Status: \\u274c Incorrect\\n- Extracted answer: None\\n\\n## Your Previous Reasoning Trajectory\\n\\n\\n\\n## Instructions\\nYour previous answer was incorrect.
