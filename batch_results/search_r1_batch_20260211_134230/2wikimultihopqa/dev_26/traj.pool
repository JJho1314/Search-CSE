Look for incorrect assumptions, confusion between similar entities, or missing logical steps.\n4. **Verify Answer Format**: Ensure the answer is placed inside <answer>...</answer> tags and is concise (e.g., a name, date, or short phrase — not a full sentence).\n5. **Try Different Angles**: If direct search failed, try searching for related entities, events, or alternative formulations of the question.\n"

Arnold died of arteriosclerosis in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, California at the age of 75. Later that year, the UCLA Film Archive held a tribute \"\"Jack Arnold: The Incredible Thinking Man\"\" film festival which screened a number of his films. The Archive also produced and screened a bio-documentary about his life, \"\"The Incredible Thinking Man\"\". Jack Arnold (director) Jack Arnold (October 14, 1916 – March 17, 1992) was an American actor and film and television director,\n  Doc 2(Title: \"Roger Corman\") than directed. These titles include \"\"Rock 'n' Roll High School\"\", \"\"Death Race 2000\"\", \"\"Galaxy of Terror\"\", \"\"Forbidden World\"\" and \"\"Piranha\"\", with additional titles continuing to be released. On April 3, 2018, a lawsuit by Corman’s sons, Roger Martin Corman and Brian Corman, was filed against Corman to prevent the trade of his film collection. The sons stated that the film collection is an asset of The Pacific Trust which was created by their parents for them.

Corman produced the 2017 film \"\"Death Race 2050\"\", a sequel to the 1975 film \"\"Death Race 2000\"\". It was made with Universal, Corman's first film with a major studio in a long time.

Arnold died of arteriosclerosis in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, California at the age of 75. Later that year, the UCLA Film Archive held a tribute \"\"Jack Arnold: The Incredible Thinking Man\"\" film festival which screened a number of his films. The Archive also produced and screened a bio-documentary about his life, \"\"The Incredible Thinking Man\"\". Jack Arnold (director) Jack Arnold (October 14, 1916 – March 17, 1992) was an American actor and film and television director,\n  Doc 2(Title: \"Roger Corman\") than directed. These titles include \"\"Rock 'n' Roll High School\"\", \"\"Death Race 2000\"\", \"\"Galaxy of Terror\"\", \"\"Forbidden World\"\" and \"\"Piranha\"\", with additional titles continuing to be released. On April 3, 2018, a lawsuit by Corman’s sons, Roger Martin Corman and Brian Corman, was filed against Corman to prevent the trade of his film collection. The sons stated that the film collection is an asset of The Pacific Trust which was created by their parents for them.

Corman produced the 2017 film \"\"Death Race 2050\"\", a sequel to the 1975 film \"\"Death Race 2000\"\". It was made with Universal, Corman's first film with a major studio in a long time.

Arnold died of arteriosclerosis in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, California at the age of 75. Later that year, the UCLA Film Archive held a tribute \"\"Jack Arnold: The Incredible Thinking Man\"\" film festival which screened a number of his films. The Archive also produced and screened a bio-documentary about his life, \"\"The Incredible Thinking Man\"\". Jack Arnold (director) Jack Arnold (October 14, 1916 – March 17, 1992) was an American actor and film and television director,\n  Doc 2(Title: \"Roger Corman\") than directed.

On April 3, 2018, a lawsuit by Corman’s sons, Roger Martin Corman and Brian Corman, was filed against Corman to prevent the trade of his film collection. The sons stated that the film collection is an asset of The Pacific Trust which was created by their parents for them.

Later that year, the UCLA Film Archive held a tribute \"\"Jack Arnold: The Incredible Thinking Man\"\" film festival which screened a number of his films. The Archive also produced and screened a bio-documentary about his life, \"\"The Incredible Thinking Man\"\".

On April 3, 2018, a lawsuit by Corman’s sons, Roger Martin Corman and Brian Corman, was filed against Corman to prevent the trade of his film collection. The sons stated that the film collection is an asset of The Pacific Trust which was created by their parents for them.

He has been called \"\"The Pope of Pop\n  Doc 3(Title: \"Roger Corman\") of rock-and-roll legend Johnny Splatter. He also started contributing trailer commentaries to Dante's web series \"\"Trailers from Hell\"\". By now the SyFy channel was Corman's leading market. For them he made \"\"Sharktopus\"\" (2010) and \"\"Piranhaconda\"\" (2012). \"\"Virtually Heroes\"\" (2013) was Corman's first film to play at the Sundance Film Festival. Corman produced the 2017 film \"\"Death Race 2050\"\", a sequel to the 1975 film \"\"Death Race 2000\"\". It was made with Universal, Corman's first film with a major studio in a long time. Corman married Julie Halloran on December 26, 1970. They have four children.

Did they target the right entities and relationships? Were they too broad or too narrow? Try more specific or alternative phrasings.\n2. **Check Information Extraction**: Did the search results contain the answer? If yes, identify where the agent failed to notice or use it. If no, the queries need to be reformulated.\n3. **Fix Reasoning Chain**: Trace the logic from search results to the final answer. Look for incorrect assumptions, confusion between similar entities, or missing logical steps.\n4. **Verify Answer Format**: Ensure the answer is placed inside <answer>...</answer> tags and is concise (e.g., a name, date, or short phrase — not a full sentence).\n5. **Try Different Angles**: If direct search failed, try searching for related entities, events, or alternative formulations of the question.\n"

If no, the queries need to be reformulated.\n3. **Fix Reasoning Chain**: Trace the logic from search results to the final answer. Look for incorrect assumptions, confusion between similar entities, or missing logical steps.\n4. **Verify Answer Format**: Ensure the answer is placed inside <answer>...</answer> tags and is concise (e.g., a name, date, or short phrase — not a full sentence).\n5. **Try Different Angles**: If direct search failed, try searching for related entities, events, or alternative formulations of the question.\n"

Arnold died of arteriosclerosis in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, California at the age of 75. Later that year, the UCLA Film Archive held a tribute \"\"Jack Arnold: The Incredible Thinking Man\"\" film festival which screened a number of his films. The Archive also produced and screened a bio-documentary about his life, \"\"The Incredible Thinking Man\"\". Jack Arnold (director) Jack Arnold (October 14, 1916 – March 17, 1992) was an American actor and film and television director,\n  Doc 2(Title: \"Roger Corman\") than directed.

On April 3, 2018, a lawsuit by Corman’s sons, Roger Martin Corman and Brian Corman, was filed against Corman to prevent the trade of his film collection.

Corman produced the 2017 film \"\"Death Race 2050\"\", a sequel to the 1975 film \"\"Death Race 2000\"\". It was made with Universal, Corman's first film with a major studio in a long time.
