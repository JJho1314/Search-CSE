The first attempt focused on finding directors and their death dates, while the second attempt directly searched for the directors of 'Condemned Women' and 'Faces In The Dark'. The combined approach utilized all discovered information to determine which film had the director who died earlier.\n    search_queries:\n      - film directors who directed Condemned Women and Faces In The Dark\n      - death dates of Jack Smight and Sam Peckinpah\n      - compare death dates of Jack Smight and Sam Peckinpah\n    reasoning_quality: Logical and complete reasoning chain. The agent efficiently used the search results to compare the death dates of the directors and correctly concluded that 'Faces In The Dark' had the director who died earlier.\n    answer_quality: Correct. The final answer directly addresses the question by specifying the film with the director who died earlier.\n    key_learnings: This strategy effectively utilizes search results to gather necessary information and reason through comparisons to reach the correct answer.

If T1 found relevant context about one aspect and T2 about another, combine both pieces of evidence.\n2. **Cross-validate Reasoning**: If both attempts reached different conclusions, use the search results from both to determine which reasoning chain is more supported by evidence.\n3. **Fill Knowledge Gaps**: If T1 missed a key fact that T2 found (or vice versa), ensure the combined approach uses all discovered information.\n4. **Avoid Shared Errors**: If both attempts made the same reasoning mistake, you MUST try a fundamentally different search approach or reasoning strategy for that part.\n5. **Produce Clean Answer**: The final answer should be a single, well-supported response inside <answer>...</answer> tags, backed by evidence from the combined search results.\n"
