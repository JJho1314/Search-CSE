Finally, it concluded that 'Faces In The Dark' had the director who died earlier.\n    search_queries:\n      - film directors who directed Condemned Women and Faces In The Dark\n      - death dates of Jack Smight and Sam Peckinpah\n      - compare death dates of Jack Smight and Sam Peckinpah\n    reasoning_quality: Logical and effective. The agent efficiently used the search results to compare the death dates of the directors.\n    answer_quality: Correct. The final answer directly addresses the question by specifying the film with the director who died earlier.\n    key_learnings: This strategy effectively utilizes search results to gather necessary information and reason through comparisons to reach the correct answer.\n  iteration: 1\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Faces In The Dark\n    ground_truth:\n      - Condemned Women\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: False\n    subem_match: False\n    failure_reason: Answer 'Faces In The Dark' does not match any of ['Condemned Women']\n  source_entry_labels:\n\n  operator_name: plan\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\n### REFINEMENT GUIDELINES\n1. **Diagnose Search Quality**: Review the search queries used. Did they target the right entities and relationships? Were they too broad or too narrow? Try more specific or alternative phrasings.\n2. **Check Information Extraction**: Did the search results contain the answer? If yes, identify where the agent failed to notice or use it. If no, the queries need to be reformulated.\n3. **Fix Reasoning Chain**: Trace the logic from search results to the final answer. Look for incorrect assumptions, confusion between similar entities, or missing logical steps.\n4. **Verify Answer Format**: Ensure the answer is placed inside <answer>...</answer> tags and is concise (e.g., a name, date, or short phrase — not a full sentence).\n5. **Try Different Angles**: If direct search failed, try searching for related entities, events, or alternative formulations of the question.\n",
