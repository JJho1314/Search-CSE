After reasoning, if you find you lack some knowledge, you can call a search engine by <search> query </search> and it will return the top searched results between <information> and </information>. You can search as many times as you want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Which film has the director died earlier, Condemned Women or Faces In The Dark?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: REFLECTION AND REFINE STRATEGY\nYour previous attempt at answering a factual question using search and reasoning did not produce\nthe correct answer.

Jack Sm\n  ```\n  metric: 0.0\n  summary:\n    solution_name: crossover_strategy\n    approach_summary: The agent employed a crossover strategy, combining the best search strategies and reasoning from two previous attempts to produce a correct answer. The first attempt focused on finding directors and their death dates, while the second attempt directly searched for the directors of 'Condemned Women' and 'Faces In The Dark'. The combined approach utilized all discovered information to determine which film had the director who died earlier.\n    search_queries:\n      - film directors who directed Condemned Women and Faces In The Dark\n      - death dates of Jack Smight and Sam Peckinpah\n      - compare death dates of Jack Smight and Sam Peckinpah\n    reasoning_quality: Logical and complete reasoning chain. The agent efficiently used the search results to compare the death dates of the directors and correctly concluded that 'Faces In The Dark' had the director who died earlier.\n    answer_quality: Correct. The final answer directly addresses the question by specifying the film with the director who died earlier.\n    key_learnings: This strategy effectively utilizes search results to gather necessary information and reason through comparisons to reach the correct answer. It demonstrates the importance of combining multiple search results and strategies to ensure completeness and accuracy in answering the question.\n  iteration: 19\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: ...\n    ground_truth:\n      - Condemned Women\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: False\n    subem_match: False\n    failure_reason: Answer '...' does not match any of ['Condemned Women']\n  source_entry_labels:\n    - iter1_sol8\n    - iter2_sol3\n  operator_name: crossover\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\n### REFINEMENT GUIDELINES\n1. **Diagnose Search Quality**: Review the search queries used. Did they target the right entities and relationships? Were they too broad or too narrow? Try more specific or alternative phrasings.\n2. **Check Information Extraction**: Did the search results contain the answer? If yes, identify where the agent failed to notice or use it. If no, the queries need to be reformulated.\n3. **Fix Reasoning Chain**: Trace the logic from search results to the final answer. Look for incorrect assumptions, confusion between similar entities, or missing logical steps.\n4. **Verify Answer Format**: Ensure the answer is placed inside <answer>...</answer> tags and is concise (e.g., a name, date, or short phrase \u2014 not a full sentence).\n5. **Try Different Angles**: If direct search failed, try searching for related entities, events, or alternative formulations of the question.\n"
