  "solution": "### STRATEGY MODE: REFLECTION AND REFINE STRATEGY\nYour previous attempt at answering a factual question using search and reasoning did not produce\nthe correct answer. The only goal is correctness — producing an answer that exactly matches\nthe ground truth. Analyze why the previous attempt failed and fix it.\n\nCommon failure modes:\n- **Wrong Search Queries**: The queries did not find the relevant information needed to answer the question.\n- **Missed Key Information**: The search returned useful results but the agent failed to extract the critical fact.\n- **Reasoning Error**: The agent found relevant information but drew an incorrect conclusion.\n- **Format Error**: The agent knew the answer but did not format it correctly in <answer>...</answer> tags.\nIdentify which category applies, then focus your fix accordingly.\n\n### SOURCE TRAJECTORY SUMMARY\n  iter1_sol7\n  label: iter1_sol7\n  solution:\n  ```\n  ### STRATEGY MODE: CROSSOVER STRATEGY\n  I will combine the useful search strategies and reasoning from both attempts to produce a correct answer.\n\n  ### TRAJECTORY 1 SUMMARY\n  - **Correct Search Queries**: Found the directors of 'Condemned Women' and 'Faces In The Dark'.\n  - **Key Information Found**: Directors' names and their death dates.\n  - **Reasoning Quality**: Logical and effective in comparing the death dates.\n  - **Answer Quality**: Correctly identified the director who died earlier.\n\n  ### TRAJECTORY 2 SUMMARY\n  - **Direct Search**: Found the directors of 'Condemned Women' and 'Faces In The Dark'.\n  - **Key Information Found**: Directors' names.\n  - **Reasoning Quality**: Logical and complete reasoning chain.\n  - **Answer Quality**: Correctly identified the director who died earlier.\n\n  ### COMBINED APPROACH\n  1. **Search for Directors**: I will find the directors of 'Condemned Women' and 'Faces In The Dark'.\n  2. **Find Death Dates**: I will find the death dates of these directors.\n  3. **Compare Death Dates**: I will compare the death dates to determine which director died earlier.\n  4. **Provide Answer**: I will provide the correct answer based on the comparison.\n\n  ### SEARCH\n  <think>\n  I need to find out the directors of 'Condemned Women' and 'Faces In The Dark'.\n  </think>",
