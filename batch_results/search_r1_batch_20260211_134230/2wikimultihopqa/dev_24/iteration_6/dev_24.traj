You can search as many times as you want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations.

The only goal is correctness — producing an answer that exactly matches\nthe ground truth. Analyze why the previous attempt failed and fix it.\n\nCommon failure modes:\n- **Wrong Search Queries**: The queries did not find the relevant information needed to answer the question.\n- **Missed Key Information**: The search returned useful results but the agent failed to extract the critical fact.\n- **Reasoning Error**: The agent found relevant information but drew an incorrect conclusion.\n- **Format Error**: The agent knew the answer but did not format it correctly in <answer>...</answer> tags.\nIdentify which category applies, then focus your fix accordingly.\n\n### SOURCE TRAJECTORY SUMMARY\n  iter1_sol1\n  label: iter1_sol1\n  solution:\n  ```\n  <think>\n  I need to find out who Catherine of Pomerania, Countess Palatine of Neumarkt's father-in-law is.\n  </think>\n  <search>Who is Catherine of Pomerania, Countess Palatine of Neumarkt's father-in-law?</search>\n\n  <information>\n  Catherine of Pomerania, Countess Palatine of Neumarkt, was married to Frederick III, Elector Palatine.\n  </information>\n\n  <think>\n  I know Catherine of Pomerania was married to Frederick III, Elector Palatine.

It first identified that she was married to Frederick III, Elector Palatine, and then searched for his father-in-law, leading to the discovery that James I of England was the father-in-law of Elizabeth Stuart, who was married to Frederick III.\n    search_queries:\n      - <search>Who is Catherine of Pomerania, Countess Palatine of Neumarkt's father-in-law?</search>\n      - <search>Who is the father-in-law of Frederick III, Elector Palatine?</search>\n    reasoning_quality: Logical and effective, as the agent correctly connected the information to find the father-in-law.\n    answer_quality: The answer 'James I of England' is correct but does not directly address the question since the question specifically asks for Catherine of Pomerania's father-in-law, not Elizabeth Stuart's father-in-law. Thus, the answer should ideally be 'Frederick III, Elector Palatine'.\n    key_learnings: Effective search strategies for this type of question involve searching for each intermediate link in the lineage and ensuring the reasoning chain is clear and logically connected. The agent could improve by specifying the exact father-in-law of Catherine of Pomerania instead of just James I of England.\n  iteration: 1\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: James I of England\n    ground_truth:\n      - Rupert, King of Germany\n      - Rupert\n      - Ruprecht\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: False\n    subem_match: False\n    failure_reason: Answer 'James I of England' does not match any of ['Rupert, King of Germany', 'Rupert', 'Ruprecht']\n  source_entry_labels:\n\n  operator_name: plan\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\n### REFINEMENT GUIDELINES\n1. **Diagnose Search Quality**: Review the search queries used. Did they target the right entities and relationships? Were they too broad or too narrow? Try more specific or alternative phrasings.\n2. **Check Information Extraction**: Did the search results contain the answer? If yes, identify where the agent failed to notice or use it. If no, the queries need to be reformulated.\n3. **Fix Reasoning Chain**: Trace the logic from search results to the final answer. Look for incorrect assumptions, confusion between similar entities, or missing logical steps.\n4. **Verify Answer Format**: Ensure the answer is placed inside <answer>...</answer> tags and is concise (e.g., a name, date, or short phrase — not a full sentence).\n5. **Try Different Angles**: If direct search failed, try searching for related entities, events, or alternative formulations of the question.\n",
