For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Who is Catherine Of Pomerania, Countess Palatine Of Neumarkt's father-in-law?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  Use a Trie for Inheritance Lineage: Construct a trie data structure where each node represents a noble and their children. This strategy allows for efficient retrieval of the father-in-law by traversing the trie from a given noble. The time complexity is O(log N) for tree traversals, and the space complexity is O(N) for storing the trie.\n"
