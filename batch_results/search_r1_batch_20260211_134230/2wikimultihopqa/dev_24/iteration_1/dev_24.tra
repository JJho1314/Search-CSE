You can search as many times as you want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Who is Catherine Of Pomerania, Countess Palatine Of Neumarkt's father-in-law?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  Perform a Pre-emptive Historical Lookup: Utilize a pre-computed database of noble lineage. This strategy leverages a hash map to map each noble's name to their father-in-law's name, enabling O(1) retrieval time. The space complexity is O(N), where N is the number of nobles, but the operation is highly efficient.\n"
