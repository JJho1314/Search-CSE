However, it is crucial to ensure the final answer directly addresses the question.\n  iteration: 11\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: null\n    ground_truth:\n      - Rupert, King of Germany\n      - Rupert\n      - Ruprecht\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    failure_reason: No <answer>...</answer> tag found\n  source_entry_labels:\n    - iter1_sol3\n    - iter1_sol8\n  operator_name: crossover\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\n### REFINEMENT GUIDELINES\n1. **Diagnose Search Quality**: Review the search queries used.

Try more specific or alternative phrasings.\n2. **Check Information Extraction**: Did the search results contain the answer? If yes, identify where the agent failed to notice or use it. If no, the queries need to be reformulated.\n3. **Fix Reasoning Chain**: Trace the logic from search results to the final answer. Look for incorrect assumptions, confusion between similar entities, or missing logical steps.\n4. **Verify Answer Format**: Ensure the answer is placed inside <answer>...</answer> tags and is concise (e.g., a name, date, or short phrase — not a full sentence).\n5. **Try Different Angles**: If direct search failed, try searching for related entities, events, or alternative formulations of the question.\n",
