It then traced back through multiple generations, searching for each parent until reaching a point where it needed more specific information about a historical figure, Philip I, King of Castile. The agent then had to search for Philip I's father, Charles V, and ultimately needed to find Charles V's father, Philip I, King of Castile's father, which led to Ferdinand III.\n    search_queries:\n      - Who is Catherine of Pomerania, Countess Palatine of Neumarkt's father-in-law?\n      - Who is the father of Charles I, Elector Palatine?\n      - Who is the father of Elector Frederick III of the Palatinate?\n      - Who is the father of Elector Philip I of the Palatinate?\n      - Who is the father of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor?\n      - Who is the father of Philip I, King of Castile and Aragon?\n    reasoning_quality: The reasoning chain was logical but missed connections from higher-level historical figures back to the direct lineage. It could have optimized the search by focusing directly on higher-level historical figures or using a more efficient search strategy for nested lineage queries.\n    answer_quality: The final answer 'Ferdinand III' was incorrect because it was not directly related to the question about Catherine of Pomerania's father-in-law, Charles I, Elector Palatine. The agent should have stopped at the point where it found Charles I's father, Elector Frederick III, and then traced back to his father, Philip I, Elector Palatinate, who is the father-in-law of Catherine of Pomerania.\n    key_learnings: For this type of question, it is crucial to identify and focus on the direct lineage relevant to the query. Searching the lineage of higher historical figures without a clear path to the specific individual can lead to incorrect answers. A more structured approach focusing on direct lineage connections would be more effective.\n  iteration: 3\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Ferdinand III\n    ground_truth:\n      - Rupert, King of Germany\n      - Rupert\n      - Ruprecht\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: False\n    subem_match: False\n    failure_reason: Answer 'Ferdinand III' does not match any of ['Rupert, King of Germany', 'Rupert', 'Ruprecht']\n  source_entry_labels:\n\n  operator_name: plan\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\n### TRAJECTORY 2 SUMMARY\n  iter1_sol8\n  label: iter1_sol8\n  solution:\n  ```\n  <think>\n  1.

If T1 found relevant context about one aspect and T2 about another, combine both pieces of evidence.\n2. **Cross-validate Reasoning**: If both attempts reached different conclusions, use the search results from both to determine which reasoning chain is more supported by evidence.\n3. **Fill Knowledge Gaps**: If T1 missed a key fact that T2 found (or vice versa), ensure the combined approach uses all discovered information.\n4. **Avoid Shared Errors**: If both attempts made the same reasoning mistake, you MUST try a fundamentally different search approach or reasoning strategy for that part.\n5. **Produce Clean Answer**: The final answer should be a single, well-supported response inside <answer>...</answer> tags, backed by evidence from the combined search results.\n",
