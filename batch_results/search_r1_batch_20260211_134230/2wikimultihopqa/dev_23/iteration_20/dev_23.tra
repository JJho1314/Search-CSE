The agent first identified the directors of the films and then searched for their ages to determine the younger director. Finally, the agent found the film with the younger director and provided the correct answer.\n    search_queries:\n      - <search>director of Heads I Win, director of The Incredible Sarah</search>\n      - <search>Joshua Leonard age, Bryan Bertino age</search>\n      - <search>age comparison Joshua Leonard vs Bryan Bertino</search>\n      - <search>director of Heads I Win</search>\n      - <search>director of The Incredible Sarah</search>\n      - <search>Heads I Win, The Incredible Sarah, younger director</search>\n    reasoning_quality: Logical and effective. The agent refined the search based on the results and directly answered the question.\n    answer_quality: Correct. The agent provided the correct answer 'Heads I Win'.\n    key_learnings: Direct search followed by reasoning can be an effective strategy for answering factual questions with search-augmented QA.\n  iteration: 2\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Heads I Win\n    ground_truth:\n      - Testa o croce\n      - Heads I Win, Tails You Lose\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: False\n    subem_match: False\n    failure_reason: Answer 'Heads I Win' does not match any of ['Testa o croce', 'Heads I Win, Tails You Lose']\n  source_entry_labels:\n\n  operator_name: plan\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\n### REFINEMENT GUIDELINES\n1. **Diagnose Search Quality**: Review the search queries used. Did they target the right entities and relationships? Were they too broad or too narrow? Try more specific or alternative phrasings.\n2. **Check Information Extraction**: Did the search results contain the answer? If yes, identify where the agent failed to notice or use it. If no, the queries need to be reformulated.\n3. **Fix Reasoning Chain**: Trace the logic from search results to the final answer. Look for incorrect assumptions, confusion between similar entities, or missing logical steps.\n4. **Verify Answer Format**: Ensure the answer is placed inside <answer>...</answer> tags and is concise (e.g., a name, date, or short phrase \u2014 not a full sentence).\n5. **Try Different Angles**: If direct search failed, try searching for related entities, events, or alternative formulations of the question.\n"
