It then reasoned about who is younger and finally searched for the director of 'The Incredible Sarah' to provide the answer.\n    search_queries:\n      - <search>who are the directors of Heads I Win, Tails You Lose, and The Incredible Sarah and their ages</search>\n      - <search>ages of John Dahl and Mark Steven Johnson</search>\n      - <search>director of The Incredible Sarah</search>\n    reasoning_quality: The reasoning chain was logical and followed a step-by-step approach to determine the youngest director and the corresponding film.\n    answer_quality: The final answer 'The Incredible Sarah' directly addresses the question.\n    key_learnings: For this type of question, it is effective to directly search for the required information (directors and their ages) and reason step-by-step to find the answer.\n  iteration: 10\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: ...\n    ground_truth:\n      - Testa o croce\n      - Heads I Win, Tails You Lose\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: False\n    subem_match: False\n    failure_reason: Answer '...' does not match any of ['Testa o croce', 'Heads I Win, Tails You Lose']\n  source_entry_labels:\n    - iter1_sol5\n  operator_name: reflection_refine\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\n### REFINEMENT GUIDELINES\n1. **Diagnose Search Quality**: Review the search queries used. Did they target the right entities and relationships? Were they too broad or too narrow? Try more specific or alternative phrasings.\n2. **Check Information Extraction**: Did the search results contain the answer? If yes, identify where the agent failed to notice or use it. If no, the queries need to be reformulated.\n3. **Fix Reasoning Chain**: Trace the logic from search results to the final answer. Look for incorrect assumptions, confusion between similar entities, or missing logical steps.\n4. **Verify Answer Format**: Ensure the answer is placed inside <answer>...</answer> tags and is concise (e.g., a name, date, or short phrase \u2014 not a full sentence).\n5. **Try Different Angles**: If direct search failed, try searching for related entities, events, or alternative formulations of the question.\n"
