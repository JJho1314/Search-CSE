If T1 found relevant context about one aspect and T2 about another, combine both pieces of evidence.\n2. **Cross-validate Reasoning**: If both attempts reached different conclusions, use the search results from both to determine which reasoning chain is more supported by evidence.\n3. **Fill Knowledge Gaps**: If T1 missed a key fact that T2 found (or vice versa), ensure the combined approach uses all discovered information.\n4. **Avoid Shared Errors**: If both attempts made the same reasoning mistake, you MUST try a fundamentally different search approach or reasoning strategy for that part.\n5. **Produce Clean Answer**: The final answer should be a single, well-supported response inside <answer>...</answer> tags, backed by evidence from the combined search results.\n",
