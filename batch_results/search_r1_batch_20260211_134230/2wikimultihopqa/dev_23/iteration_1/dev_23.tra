After reasoning, if you find you lack some knowledge, you can call a search engine by <search> query </search> and it will return the top searched results between <information> and </information>. You can search as many times as you want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Which film whose director is younger, Heads I Win, Tails You Lose or The Incredible Sarah?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  This strategy involves a simple dictionary lookup to find the film with the youngest director. It uses a hash map to store film names and their respective directors' ages. The algorithm iterates through the entries, comparing the age of the director to find the youngest one. The time complexity is O(n) where n is the number of films, and the space complexity is also O(n) for storing the directors' ages.\n"
