You can search as many times as you want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Which film whose director is younger, Heads I Win, Tails You Lose or The Incredible Sarah?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  This strategy uses a greedy approach to find the film with the youngest director. It iterates through the list of films, keeping track of the film with the youngest director encountered so far. The time complexity is O(n) as it requires a single pass through the list, and the space complexity is O(1) as only the current film and the youngest director found so far are stored.\n"
