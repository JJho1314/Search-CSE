After reasoning, if you find you lack some knowledge, you can call a search engine by <search> query </search> and it will return the top searched results between <information> and </information>. You can search as many times as you want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Which film whose director is younger, Heads I Win, Tails You Lose or The Incredible Sarah?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  This strategy employs a binary search algorithm to find the film with the youngest director. It assumes that the list of films is sorted by director's age. The algorithm performs logarithmic searches to find the youngest director, resulting in a time complexity of O(log n). The space complexity is O(1) as no additional space is used.\n"
