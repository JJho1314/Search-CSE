Your task is to combine the best search strategies\nand reasoning from both attempts to produce a correct answer.\n\nAnalyze each trajectory to understand:\n- Which search queries found useful information and which did not\n- What relevant facts each attempt discovered\n- Where each attempt's reasoning went wrong\n- Whether either attempt was close to the correct answer\n\n### TRAJECTORY 1 SUMMARY\n  iter1_sol8\n  label: iter1_sol8\n  solution:\n  ```\n  ### NEW STRATEGY: FOCUS ON DIRECTOR AGE COMPARISON AND FILM IDENTIFICATION\n\n  ### REASONING:\n  1.

I also need to find out the ages of these directors.\n  4. Compare the ages to determine who is younger.\n  5.

If T1 found relevant context about one aspect and T2 about another, combine both pieces of evidence.\n2. **Cross-validate Reasoning**: If both attempts reached different conclusions, use the search results from both to determine which reasoning chain is more supported by evidence.\n3. **Fill Knowledge Gaps**: If T1 missed a key fact that T2 found (or vice versa), ensure the combined approach uses all discovered information.\n4. **Avoid Shared Errors**: If both attempts made the same reasoning mistake, you MUST try a fundamentally different search approach or reasoning strategy for that part.\n5. **Produce Clean Answer**: The final answer should be a single, well-supported response inside <answer>...</answer> tags, backed by evidence from the combined search results.\n"
