You can search as many times as you want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Which film whose director is younger, Heads I Win, Tails You Lose or The Incredible Sarah?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: REFLECTION AND REFINE STRATEGY\nYour previous attempt at answering a factual question using search and reasoning did not produce\nthe correct answer.

The agent effectively used the search results to compare the ages of the directors and arrive at the correct answer.\n    answer_quality: Correct. The final answer 'Heads I Win' directly addresses the question.\n    key_learnings: Effective use of direct searches to gather necessary information and logical reasoning to solve the problem.\n  iteration: 4\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Heads I Win\n    ground_truth:\n      - Testa o croce\n      - Heads I Win, Tails You Lose\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: False\n    subem_match: False\n    failure_reason: Answer 'Heads I Win' does not match any of ['Testa o croce', 'Heads I Win, Tails You Lose']\n  source_entry_labels:\n\n  operator_name: plan\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\n### REFINEMENT GUIDELINES\n1. **Diagnose Search Quality**: Review the search queries used. Did they target the right entities and relationships? Were they too broad or too narrow? Try more specific or alternative phrasings.\n2. **Check Information Extraction**: Did the search results contain the answer? If yes, identify where the agent failed to notice or use it. If no, the queries need to be reformulated.\n3. **Fix Reasoning Chain**: Trace the logic from search results to the final answer. Look for incorrect assumptions, confusion between similar entities, or missing logical steps.\n4. **Verify Answer Format**: Ensure the answer is placed inside <answer>...</answer> tags and is concise (e.g., a name, date, or short phrase \u2014 not a full sentence).\n5. **Try Different Angles**: If direct search failed, try searching for related entities, events, or alternative formulations of the question.\n"
