  "solution": "### STRATEGY MODE: REFLECTION AND REFINE STRATEGY\n\nYour previous attempt at answering a factual question using search and reasoning did not produce the correct answer. The only goal is correctness — producing an answer that exactly matches the ground truth. Analyze why the previous attempt failed and fix it.\n\nCommon failure modes:\n- **Wrong Search Queries**: The queries did not find the relevant information needed to answer the question.\n- **Missed Key Information**: The search returned useful results but the agent failed to extract the critical fact.\n- **Reasoning Error**: The agent found relevant information but drew an incorrect conclusion.\n- **Format Error**: The agent knew the answer but did not format it correctly in <answer>...</answer> tags.\n\nIdentify which category applies, then focus your fix accordingly.\n\n### SOURCE TRAJECTORY SUMMARY\n- The task is to find out which film has a younger director between \"Heads I Win\" and \"The Incredible Sarah\".\n\n### SOURCE TRAJECTORY\n1. **Search**: who are the directors of Heads I Win and The Incredible Sarah, and what are their ages?\n2. **Information**: \n   - \"Heads I Win\" is a 2004 American comedy-drama film directed by John Dahl.\n   - \"The Incredible Sarah\" is a 2003 American comedy-drama film directed by Mark Steven Johnson.\n3. **Search**: ages of John Dahl and Mark Steven Johnson\n4. **Information**: \n   - John Dahl was born on January 1, 1961.\n   - Mark Steven Johnson was born on November 11, 1964.\n5. **Think**: Since 1961 is before 1964, John Dahl is younger.\n6. **Answer**: The Incredible Sarah\n\n### REASONING QUALITY\n- The reasoning chain was logical and followed a step-by-step approach to determine the youngest director and the corresponding film.\n\n### ANSWER QUALITY\n- The final answer 'The Incredible Sarah' directly addresses the question.\n\n### KEY LEARNINGS\n- For this type of question, it is effective to directly search for the required information (directors and their ages) and reason step-by-step to find the answer.\n\n### REFINED SEARCH QUERY\n- To ensure we have the correct information about the directors' ages, let's search for the exact dates again.\n\n### REFINE SEARCH QUERY\n<search>dates of",
