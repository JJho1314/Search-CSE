It started by searching for the directors' ages of 'Heads I Win' and 'The Incredible Sarah', then compared their birth years to identify the older director. Finally, it searched for the film directed by the younger director.\n    search_queries:\n      - director age of Heads I Win, The Incredible Sarah\n      - age of Matt Ballew, age of Michael Lembeck\n      - film directed by Michael Lembeck\n    reasoning_quality: Logical and direct. The agent followed a clear plan to gather necessary information and made logical comparisons.\n    answer_quality: Correct. The final answer, 'The Incredible Sarah', directly addresses the question about the younger director.\n    key_learnings: For questions involving comparisons of attributes (like ages), it's effective to directly search for the required attributes and then compare them.\n  iteration: 3\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: The Incredible Sarah\n    ground_truth:\n      - Testa o croce\n      - Heads I Win, Tails You Lose\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: False\n    subem_match: False\n    failure_reason: Answer 'The Incredible Sarah' does not match any of ['Testa o croce', 'Heads I Win, Tails You Lose']\n  source_entry_labels:\n\n  operator_name: plan\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\n### REFINEMENT GUIDELINES\n1. **Diagnose Search Quality**: Review the search queries used. Did they target the right entities and relationships? Were they too broad or too narrow? Try more specific or alternative phrasings.\n2. **Check Information Extraction**: Did the search results contain the answer? If yes, identify where the agent failed to notice or use it. If no, the queries need to be reformulated.\n3. **Fix Reasoning Chain**: Trace the logic from search results to the final answer. Look for incorrect assumptions, confusion between similar entities, or missing logical steps.\n4. **Verify Answer Format**: Ensure the answer is placed inside <answer>...</answer> tags and is concise (e.g., a name, date, or short phrase \u2014 not a full sentence).\n5. **Try Different Angles**: If direct search failed, try searching for related entities, events, or alternative formulations of the question.\n"
