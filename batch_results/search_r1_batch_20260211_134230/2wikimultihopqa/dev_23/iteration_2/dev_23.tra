After reasoning, if you find you lack some knowledge, you can call a search engine by <search> query </search> and it will return the top searched results between <information> and </information>. You can search as many times as you want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Which film whose director is younger, Heads I Win, Tails You Lose or The Incredible Sarah?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  The second strategy applies a custom sorting algorithm that sorts the films based on the age of their directors. It uses the QuickSort algorithm, which has an average-case time complexity of O(n log n) but can degrade to O(n^2) in the worst case. The space complexity is O(log n) due to the recursive calls of the sorting algorithm.\n"
