The only goal is correctness — producing an answer that exactly matches\nthe ground truth. Analyze why the previous attempt failed and fix it.\n\nCommon failure modes:\n- **Wrong Search Queries**: The queries did not find the relevant information needed to answer the question.\n- **Missed Key Information**: The search returned useful results but the agent failed to extract the critical fact.\n- **Reasoning Error**: The agent found relevant information but drew an incorrect conclusion.\n- **Format Error**: The agent knew the answer but did not format it correctly in <answer>...</answer> tags.\nIdentify which category applies, then focus your fix accordingly.\n\n### SOURCE TRAJECTORY SUMMARY\n  iter1_sol5\n  label: iter1_sol5\n  solution:\n  ```\n  <think>\n  - The task is to find which film between \"Heads I Win\" and \"The Incredible Sarah\" has a director who is younger.\n  </think>\n  <search>who are the directors of Heads I Win, Tails You Lose, and The Incredible Sarah and their ages</search>\n\n  <information>\n  - \"Heads I Win\" is a 2004 American comedy-drama film directed by John Dahl.\n  - \"Tails You Lose\" is a 2008 American drama film directed by John Dahl.\n  - \"The Incredible Sarah\" is a 2003 American comedy-drama film directed by Mark Steven Johnson.\n  </information>\n\n  <think>\n  - I need to check the ages of John Dahl and Mark Steven Johnson to determine who is younger.\n  </think>\n  <search>ages of John Dahl and Mark Steven Johnson</search>\n\n  <information>\n  - John Dahl was born on January 1, 1961.\n  - Mark Steven Johnson was born on November 11, 1964.\n  </information>\n\n  <think>\n  - John Dahl was born in 1961, and Mark Steven Johnson was born in 1964.
