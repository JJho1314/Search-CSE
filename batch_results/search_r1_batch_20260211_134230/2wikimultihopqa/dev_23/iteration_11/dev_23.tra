The reasoning chain effectively uses the search results to make informed decisions.\n    answer_quality: Correct. The final answer, 'The Incredible Sarah', is directly derived from the search results and reasoning process.\n    key_learnings: For this type of question, a multi-hop search strategy is effective.

The only goal is correctness \u2014 producing an answer that exactly matches\n  the ground truth. Analyze why the previous attempt failed and fix it.\n\n  Common failure modes:\n  - **Wrong Search Queries**: The queries did not find the relevant information needed to answer the question.\n  - **Missed Key Information**: The search returned useful results but the agent failed to extract the critical fact.\n  - **Reasoning Error**: The agent found relevant information but drew an incorrect conclusion.\n  - **Format Error**: The agent knew the answer but did not format it correctly in <answer>...</answer> tags.\n  Identify which category applies, then focus your fix accordingly.\n\n  ### SOURCE TRAJECTORY SUMMARY\n    iter1_sol5\n    label: iter1_sol5\n    solution:\n    ```\n    <think>\n    - The task is to find which film between \"Heads I Win\" and \"The Incredible Sarah\" has a director who is younger.\n    </think>\n    <search>who are the directors of Heads I Win, Tails You Lose, and The Incredible Sarah and their ages</search>\n\n    <information>\n    - \"Heads I Win\" is a 2004 American comedy-drama film directed by John Dahl.\n    - \"Tails You Lose\" is a 2008 American drama film directed by John Dahl.\n    - \"The Incredible Sarah\" is a 2003 American comedy-drama film directed by Mark Steven Johnson.\n    </information>\n\n    <think>\n    - I need to check the ages of John Dahl and Mark Steven Johnson to determine who is younger.\n    </think>\n    <search>ages of John Dahl and Mark Steven Johnson</search>\n\n    <information>\n    - John Dahl was born on January 1, 1961.\n    - Mark Steven Johnson was born on November 11, 1964.\n    </information>\n\n    <think>\n    - John Dahl was born in 1961, and Mark Steven Johnson was born in 1964.

It then reasoned about who is younger and finally searched for the director of 'The Incredible Sarah' to provide the answer.\n    search_queries:\n      - <search>who are the directors of Heads I Win, Tails You Lose, and The Incredible Sarah and their ages</search>\n      - <search>ages of John Dahl and Mark Steven Johnson</search>\n      - <search>director of The Incredible Sarah</search>\n    reasoning_quality: The reasoning chain was logical and followed a step-by-step approach to determine the youngest director and the corresponding film.\n    answer_quality: The final answer 'The Incredible Sarah' directly addresses the question.\n    key_learnings: For this type of question, it is effective to directly search for the required information (directors and their ages) and reason step-by-step to find the answer.\n  iteration: 10\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: ...\n    ground_truth:\n      - Testa o croce\n      - Heads I Win, Tails You Lose\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: False\n    subem_match: False\n    failure_reason: Answer '...' does not match any of ['Testa o croce', 'Heads I Win, Tails You Lose']\n  source_entry_labels:\n    - iter1_sol5\n  operator_name: reflection_refine\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\n### SYNTHESIS GUIDELINES\n1. **Combine Search Strategies**: Use the most effective search queries from both attempts. If T1 found relevant context about one aspect and T2 about another, combine both pieces of evidence.\n2. **Cross-validate Reasoning**: If both attempts reached different conclusions, use the search results from both to determine which reasoning chain is more supported by evidence.\n3. **Fill Knowledge Gaps**: If T1 missed a key fact that T2 found (or vice versa), ensure the combined approach uses all discovered information.\n4. **Avoid Shared Errors**: If both attempts made the same reasoning mistake, you MUST try a fundamentally different search approach or reasoning strategy for that part.\n5. **Produce Clean Answer**: The final answer should be a single, well-supported response inside <answer>...</answer> tags, backed by evidence from the combined search results.\n"
