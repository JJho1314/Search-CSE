After reasoning, if you find you lack some knowledge, you can call a search engine by <search> query </search> and it will return the top searched results between <information> and </information>. You can search as many times as you want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Which film was released earlier, Moment Of Danger or The Ballad Of Josie?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  A fourth strategy involves using a machine learning model trained on historical film release data. By inputting the names of the two films into the model, we can predict their release years and compare them to determine which film was released earlier. This approach has a time complexity that depends on the complexity of the model and the dataset it was trained on, but it can offer a high degree of accuracy and efficiency when dealing with similar queries.\n"
