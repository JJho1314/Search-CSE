For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Which film was released earlier, Moment Of Danger or The Ballad Of Josie?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  This strategy involves a simple Lexical Comparison. By comparing the release years of the two films, we can determine which film was released earlier. The time complexity of this approach is O(1) since it only requires a single comparison, and the space complexity is also O(1) as no additional data structures are used.\n",
