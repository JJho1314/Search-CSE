You can search as many times as you want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Which film was released earlier, Moment Of Danger or The Ballad Of Josie?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  Another approach is to use a database or API that stores film release information. By querying this source, we can obtain the release years of both films and compare them. This method has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of records in the database, but it offers a more robust solution in terms of accuracy and efficiency when dealing with larger datasets.\n"
