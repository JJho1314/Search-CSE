You can search as many times as you want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Which film was released earlier, Moment Of Danger or The Ballad Of Josie?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  A final strategy is to use a combination of the above methods. For example, we can start by using a simple Lexical Comparison to quickly eliminate unlikely candidates, then use a database or API to verify the release years of the two films. This approach offers a balance between simplicity and accuracy, with a time complexity that depends on the specific methods used and the size of the datasets involved.\n",
