The reasoning process was logical, and the agent correctly deduced that 'The Ballad of Josie' was released earlier based on the search results.\n\n### TRAJECTORY 2 SUMMARY\nThe agent employed a direct search approach to find release years of the films 'Moment Of Danger' and 'The Ballad Of Josie'. After obtaining the release years, it reasoned about which film was released earlier by comparing the two years.\n\n### SYNTHESIS GUIDELINES\n1. **Combine Search Strategies**: Use the most effective search queries from both attempts.\n2. **Cross-validate Reasoning**: Use the search results from both to determine which reasoning chain is more supported by evidence.\n3. **Fill Knowledge Gaps**: Ensure the combined approach uses all discovered information.\n4. **Avoid Shared Errors**: If both attempts made the same reasoning mistake, try a fundamentally different search approach or reasoning strategy.\n5. **Produce Clean Answer**: The final answer should be a single, well-supported response inside <answer>...</answer> tags.\n\n### Combined Strategy\n1.
