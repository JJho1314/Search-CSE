After reasoning, if you find you lack some knowledge, you can call a search engine by <search> query </search> and it will return the top searched results between <information> and </information>. You can search as many times as you want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Which film was released earlier, Moment Of Danger or The Ballad Of Josie?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  A third strategy is to use a pre-built dictionary or lookup table that contains the release years of a wide range of films. By accessing this table, we can quickly retrieve the release years of Moment Of Danger and The Ballad Of Josie and determine which film was released earlier. This approach has a time complexity of O(1) and a space complexity of O(n), where n is the number of entries in the dictionary.\n"
