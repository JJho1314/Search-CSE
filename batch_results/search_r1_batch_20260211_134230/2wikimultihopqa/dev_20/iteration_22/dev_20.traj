After obtaining the release years, it reasoned about which film was released earlier by comparing the two years.\n    search_queries:\n      - Moment Of Danger, The Ballad Of Josie release years\n      - Moment Of Danger release year, The Ballad Of Josie release year\n      - earlier release year between Moment Of Danger and The Ballad Of Josie\n      - earlier release year: 1998 or 1999\n    reasoning_quality: Logical and effective. The agent systematically gathered necessary information and compared it correctly.\n    answer_quality: Correct. The final answer 'The Ballad Of Josie' accurately addresses the question of which film was released earlier.\n    key_learnings: Effective use of direct search followed by comparison reasoning to solve the problem. This approach can be applied to similar questions where direct comparison of factual data is required.\n  iteration: 3\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: The Ballad Of Josie\n    ground_truth:\n      - Moment Of Danger\n      - Malaga\n      - Moment of Danger\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: False\n    subem_match: False\n    failure_reason: Answer 'The Ballad Of Josie' does not match any of ['Moment Of Danger', 'Malaga', 'Moment of Danger']\n  source_entry_labels:\n\n  operator_name: plan\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\n### REFINEMENT GUIDELINES\n1. **Diagnose Search Quality**: Review the search queries used. Did they target the right entities and relationships? Were they too broad or too narrow? Try more specific or alternative phrasings.\n2. **Check Information Extraction**: Did the search results contain the answer? If yes, identify where the agent failed to notice or use it. If no, the queries need to be reformulated.\n3. **Fix Reasoning Chain**: Trace the logic from search results to the final answer. Look for incorrect assumptions, confusion between similar entities, or missing logical steps.\n4. **Verify Answer Format**: Ensure the answer is placed inside <answer>...</answer> tags and is concise (e.g., a name, date, or short phrase — not a full sentence).\n5. **Try Different Angles**: If direct search failed, try searching for related entities, events, or alternative formulations of the question.\n",
