It successfully identified the directors of both films and found out the death date of one director while not finding any information about the other.\n    search_queries:\n      -\n        query: which film has the director who died earlier, Poker In Bed or The Machine To Kill Bad People\n        effectiveness: Effective, returned relevant directors\n      -\n        query: when did Emiliano Miriello and Huanfei Li die\n        effectiveness: Effective, returned death date for Emiliano Miriello\n      -\n        query: when did Huanfei Li die\n        effectiveness: Ineffective, no information found\n      -\n        query: who is the director of The Machine to Kill Bad People\n        effectiveness: Effective, confirmed the director\n      -\n        query: when did Emiliano Miriello die\n        effectiveness: Effective, confirmed Emiliano Miriello's death date\n    reasoning_quality: Logical and thorough. The agent correctly identified the need to find death dates and then compared them to determine the answer.\n    answer_quality: Correct. The agent's final answer, 'Poker In Bed', directly addressed the question.\n    key_learnings: Effective strategies include starting with a broad search and then narrowing down with specific queries. It's crucial to follow up with additional searches when necessary.\n  iteration: 7\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Poker In Bed\n    ground_truth:\n      - The Machine To Kill Bad People\n      - La macchina ammazzacattivi\n      - The Machine to Kill Bad People\n      - Machine to Kill Bad People\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: False\n    subem_match: False\n    failure_reason: Answer 'Poker In Bed' does not match any of ['The Machine To Kill Bad People', 'La macchina ammazzacattivi', 'The Machine to Kill Bad People', 'Machine to Kill Bad People']\n  source_entry_labels:\n    - iter1_sol6\n    - iter1_sol2\n  operator_name: crossover\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\n### REFINEMENT GUIDELINES\n1. **Diagnose Search Quality**: Review the search queries used. Did they target the right entities and relationships? Were they too broad or too narrow? Try more specific or alternative phrasings.\n2. **Check Information Extraction**: Did the search results contain the answer? If yes, identify where the agent failed to notice or use it. If no, the queries need to be reformulated.\n3. **Fix Reasoning Chain**: Trace the logic from search results to the final answer. Look for incorrect assumptions, confusion between similar entities, or missing logical steps.\n4. **Verify Answer Format**: Ensure the answer is placed inside <answer>...</answer> tags and is concise (e.g., a name, date, or short phrase — not a full sentence).\n5. **Try Different Angles**: If direct search failed, try searching for related entities, events, or alternative formulations of the question.\n",
