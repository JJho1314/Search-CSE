The correct search queries and their results should be focused on these directors. \n\nSince the direct information about the death dates of Emiliano Miriello and Huanfei Li is not provided in the given summary, we need to perform the following search:\n\n<search>when did Emiliano Miriello and Huanfei Li die</search>\n\n<information>Doc 1(Title: \"Wang Huanyu\") March 2003 and October 2014.
