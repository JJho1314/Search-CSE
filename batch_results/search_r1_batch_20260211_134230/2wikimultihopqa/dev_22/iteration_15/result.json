Identify the directors of Poker In Bed and The Machine To Kill Bad People.\n2. Find the death dates of these directors.\n3. Compare the death dates to determine which director died earlier.\n4. Identify the film directed by the director who died earlier.\n\nFrom the information gathered in both trajectories:\n- Poker In Bed was directed by Emiliano Miriello.\n- The Machine To Kill Bad People was directed by Huanfei Li.\n\nWe need to find out who directed each film and when they died. The correct search queries and their results should be focused on these directors. \n\nSince the direct information about the death dates of Emiliano Miriello and Huanfei Li is not provided in the given summary, we need to perform the following search:\n\n<search>when did Emiliano Miriello and Huanfei Li die</search>\n\n<information>Doc 1(Title: \"Wang Huanyu\") March 2003 and October 2014.

The film directed by the director who died earlier will be the answer to the question.\n\nFor example, if Emiliano Miriello died in 2010 and Huanfei Li died in 2012, then Poker In Bed (directed by Emiliano Miriello) would be the film with the director who died earlier.",
