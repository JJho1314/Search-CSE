Identify the film directed by the director who died earlier.\n\nFrom the information gathered in both trajectories:\n- Poker In Bed was directed by Emiliano Miriello.\n- The Machine To Kill Bad People was directed by Huanfei Li.\n\nWe need to find out who directed each film and when they died. The correct search queries and their results should be focused on these directors. \n\nSince the direct information about the death dates of Emiliano Miriello and Huanfei Li is not provided in the given summary, we need to perform the following search:\n\n<search>when did Emiliano Miriello and Huanfei Li die</search>\n\n<information>Doc 1(Title: \"Wang Huanyu\") March 2003 and October 2014.
