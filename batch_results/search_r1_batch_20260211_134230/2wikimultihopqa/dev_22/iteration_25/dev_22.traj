The correct search queries and their results should be focused on these directors. \n\n  Since the direct information about the death dates of Emiliano Miriello and Huanfei Li is not provided in the given summary, we need to perform the following search:\n\n  <search>when did Emiliano Miriello and Huanfei Li die</search>\n\n  <information>Doc 1(Title: \"Wang Huanyu\") March 2003 and October 2014.

Since the specific death dates for both directors are not provided in the summary, we need to perform the following search:\n\n  <search>when did Emiliano Miriello and Huanfei Li die</search>\n\n  After obtaining the death dates, we can compare them to find out which director died earlier. The film directed by the director who died earlier will be the answer to the question.\n\n  For example, if Emiliano Miriello died in 2010 and Huanfei Li died in 2012, then Poker In Bed (directed by Emiliano Miriello) would be the film with the director who died earlier.\n  ```\n  metric: 0.0\n  summary:\n    approach_summary: Iteration 15 execution with 20 trajectory steps\n    modified_files:\n      - unknown\n    key_changes: Unable to analyze - LLM summarization failed\n    strategy: iteration_15_strategy\n    specific_techniques:\n      - automated_execution\n    tools_used:\n      - swe_agent\n    reasoning_pattern: step_by_step_execution\n    assumptions_made:\n      - standard_swe_agent_assumptions\n    components_touched:\n      - unknown_components\n    meta:\n      is_fallback: True\n      trajectory_length: 20\n      patch_length: 10139\n      iteration: 15\n  iteration: 15\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: null\n    ground_truth:\n      - The Machine To Kill Bad People\n      - La macchina ammazzacattivi\n      - The Machine to Kill Bad People\n      - Machine to Kill Bad People\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    failure_reason: No <answer>...</answer> tag found\n  source_entry_labels:\n    - iter1_sol14\n    - iter1_sol2\n  operator_name: crossover\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\n### TRAJECTORY 2 SUMMARY\n  iter1_sol9\n  label: iter1_sol9\n  solution:\n  ```\n  <think>\n  1.
