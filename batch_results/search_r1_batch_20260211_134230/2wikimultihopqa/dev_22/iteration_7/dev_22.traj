After reasoning, if you find you lack some knowledge, you can call a search engine by <search> query </search> and it will return the top searched results between <information> and </information>.

For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Which film has the director died earlier, Poker In Bed or The Machine To Kill Bad People?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: CROSSOVER STRATEGY\nYou are given two previous search-and-reasoning attempts at answering a factual question.\nNeither produced the correct answer. Your task is to combine the best search strategies\nand reasoning from both attempts to produce a correct answer.\n\nAnalyze each trajectory to understand:\n- Which search queries found useful information and which did not\n- What relevant facts each attempt discovered\n- Where each attempt's reasoning went wrong\n- Whether either attempt was close to the correct answer\n\n### TRAJECTORY 1 SUMMARY\n  iter1_sol6\n  label: iter1_sol6\n  solution:\n  ```\n  ### STRATEGY MODE: REFLECTION AND REFINE STRATEGY\n  Your previous attempt at answering a factual question using search and reasoning did not produce\n  the correct answer. The only goal is correctness — producing an answer that exactly matches\n  the ground truth. Analyze why the previous attempt failed and fix it.\n\n  Common failure modes:\n  - **Wrong Search Queries**: The queries did not find the relevant information needed to answer the question.\n  - **Missed Key Information**: The search returned useful results but the agent failed to extract the critical fact.\n  - **Reasoning Error**: The agent found relevant information but drew an incorrect conclusion.\n  - **Format Error**: The agent knew the answer but did not format it correctly in <answer>...</answer> tags.\n  Identify which category applies, then focus your fix accordingly.\n\n  ### SOURCE TRAJECTORY SUMMARY\n    iter1_sol2\n    label: iter1_sol2\n    solution:\n    ```\n    <think>\n    1.
