  "solution": "### STRATEGY MODE: CROSSOVER STRATEGY\nYou are given two previous search-and-reasoning attempts at answering a factual question.\nNeither produced the correct answer. Your task is to combine the best search strategies\nand reasoning from both attempts to produce a correct answer.\n\nAnalyze each trajectory to understand:\n- Which search queries found useful information and which did not\n- What relevant facts each attempt discovered\n- Where each attempt's reasoning went wrong\n- Whether either attempt was close to the correct answer\n\n### TRAJECTORY 1 SUMMARY\n  iter1_sol6\n  label: iter1_sol6\n  solution:\n  ```\n  ### STRATEGY MODE: REFLECTION AND REFINE STRATEGY\n  Your previous attempt at answering a factual question using search and reasoning did not produce\n  the correct answer. The only goal is correctness — producing an answer that exactly matches\n  the ground truth. Analyze why the previous attempt failed and fix it.\n\n  Common failure modes:\n  - **Wrong Search Queries**: The queries did not find the relevant information needed to answer the question.\n  - **Missed Key Information**: The search returned useful results but the agent failed to extract the critical fact.\n  - **Reasoning Error**: The agent found relevant information but drew an incorrect conclusion.\n  - **Format Error**: The agent knew the answer but did not format it correctly in <answer>...</answer> tags.\n  Identify which category applies, then focus your fix accordingly.\n\n  ### SOURCE TRAJECTORY SUMMARY\n    iter1_sol2\n    label: iter1_sol2\n    solution:\n    ```\n    <think>\n    1. The question asks which film has the director who died earlier, Poker In Bed or The Machine To Kill Bad People.\n    </think>\n    <search>which film has the director who died earlier, Poker In Bed or The Machine To Kill Bad People</search>\n\n    ### Search Results:\n    ```\n    1. Poker in Bed (2005) - Directed by Emiliano Miriello\n    2. The Machine to Kill Bad People (2011) - Directed by Huanfei Li\n    ```\n\n    <think>\n    1. I need to find out who directed each film and when they died.\n    </think>\n    <search>when did Emiliano Miriello and Huanfei Li die</search>\n\n    ### Search Results:\n    ```",
