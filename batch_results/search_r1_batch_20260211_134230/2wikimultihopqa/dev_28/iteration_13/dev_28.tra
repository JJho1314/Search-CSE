It started with finding the name of her husband, Stefan Uro\u0161 III, then located his place of death, Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul, Turkey). The agent used multiple search queries to gather information about the location of Constantinople, Turkey, and then the broader context of the Middle East and Asia.
