You can search as many times as you want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Where was the place of death of Anastasia Of Serbia's husband?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  We can also employ a machine learning model trained on historical data to predict the place of death based on the name of the historical figure. This involves training a model with historical data points and using it to make predictions. The expected complexity for this approach would be the time required for model training and subsequent prediction.\n"
