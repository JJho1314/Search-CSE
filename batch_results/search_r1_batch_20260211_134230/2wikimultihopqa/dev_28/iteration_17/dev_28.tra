Your task is to combine the best search strategies\nand reasoning from both attempts to produce a correct answer.\n\nAnalyze each trajectory to understand:\n- Which search queries found useful information and which did not\n- What relevant facts each attempt discovered\n- Where each attempt's reasoning went wrong\n- Whether either attempt was close to the correct answer\n\n### TRAJECTORY 1 SUMMARY\n  iter1_sol8\n  label: iter1_sol8\n  solution:\n  ```\n  ### STRATEGY MODE: REFLECTION AND REFINE STRATEGY\n  Your previous attempt at answering a factual question using search and reasoning did not produce\n  the correct answer. The only goal is correctness \u2014 producing an answer that exactly matches\n  the ground truth. Analyze why the previous attempt failed and fix it.\n\n  Common failure modes:\n  - **Wrong Search Queries**: The queries did not find the relevant information needed to answer the question.\n  - **Missed Key Information**: The search returned useful results but the agent failed to extract the critical fact.\n  - **Reasoning Error**: The agent found relevant information but drew an incorrect conclusion.\n  - **Format Error**: The agent knew the answer but did not format it correctly in <answer>...</answer> tags.\n  Identify which category applies, then focus your fix accordingly.\n\n  ### SOURCE TRAJECTORY SUMMARY\n    iter1_sol1\n    label: iter1_sol1\n    solution:\n    ```\n    <think>\n    1.

It started with finding the name of her husband, Stefan Uro\u0161 III, then located his place of death, Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul, Turkey). The agent used multiple search queries to gather information about the location of Constantinople, Turkey, and then the broader context of the Middle East and Asia. However, the final answer 'Constantinople' did not match the ground truth, which included other locations like Hilandar, Helandar, Manastir Hilandar, and others.\n    search_queries:\n      - <search>Anastasia of Serbia's husband</search>\n      - <search>Stefan Uro\u0161 III place of death</search>\n      - <search>Constantinople location</search>\n      - <search>Istanbul, Turkey location</search>\n      - <search>Turkey location</search>\n      - <search>Middle East location</search>\n      - <search>Asia location</search>\n      - <search>Istanbul, Turkey location</search>\n      - <search>Stefan Uro\u0161 III place of death</search>\n    reasoning_quality: The reasoning chain was logical, but it missed connecting the final answer to the specific place of death mentioned in the ground truth, which included other locations.\n    answer_quality: The final answer 'Constantinople' directly addressed the question but did not match the ground truth.\n    key_learnings: Effective search strategies for this type of question should ensure that the final answer is directly linked to the ground truth.

If T1 found relevant context about one aspect and T2 about another, combine both pieces of evidence.\n2. **Cross-validate Reasoning**: If both attempts reached different conclusions, use the search results from both to determine which reasoning chain is more supported by evidence.\n3. **Fill Knowledge Gaps**: If T1 missed a key fact that T2 found (or vice versa), ensure the combined approach uses all discovered information.\n4. **Avoid Shared Errors**: If both attempts made the same reasoning mistake, you MUST try a fundamentally different search approach or reasoning strategy for that part.\n5. **Produce Clean Answer**: The final answer should be a single, well-supported response inside <answer>...</answer> tags, backed by evidence from the combined search results.\n"
