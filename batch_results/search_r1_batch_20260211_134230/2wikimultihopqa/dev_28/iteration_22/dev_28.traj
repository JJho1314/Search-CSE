It started with finding the name of her husband, Stefan Uroš III, then located his place of death, Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul, Turkey). The agent used multiple search queries to gather information about the location of Constantinople, Turkey, and then the broader context of the Middle East and Asia. However, the final answer 'Constantinople' did not match the ground truth, which included other locations like Hilandar, Helandar, Manastir Hilandar, and others.\n    search_queries:\n      - <search>Anastasia of Serbia's husband</search>\n      - <search>Stefan Uroš III place of death</search>\n      - <search>Constantinople location</search>\n      - <search>Istanbul, Turkey location</search>\n      - <search>Turkey location</search>\n      - <search>Middle East location</search>\n      - <search>Asia location</search>\n      - <search>Istanbul, Turkey location</search>\n      - <search>Stefan Uroš III place of death</search>\n    reasoning_quality: The reasoning chain was logical, but it missed connecting the final answer to the specific place of death mentioned in the ground truth, which included other locations.\n    answer_quality: The final answer 'Constantinople' directly addressed the question but did not match the ground truth.\n    key_learnings: Effective search strategies for this type of question should ensure that the final answer is directly linked to the ground truth.

Did they target the right entities and relationships? Were they too broad or too narrow? Try more specific or alternative phrasings.\n2. **Check Information Extraction**: Did the search results contain the answer? If yes, identify where the agent failed to notice or use it. If no, the queries need to be reformulated.\n3. **Fix Reasoning Chain**: Trace the logic from search results to the final answer. Look for incorrect assumptions, confusion between similar entities, or missing logical steps.\n4. **Verify Answer Format**: Ensure the answer is placed inside <answer>...</answer> tags and is concise (e.g., a name, date, or short phrase — not a full sentence).\n5. **Try Different Angles**: If direct search failed, try searching for related entities, events, or alternative formulations of the question.\n",
