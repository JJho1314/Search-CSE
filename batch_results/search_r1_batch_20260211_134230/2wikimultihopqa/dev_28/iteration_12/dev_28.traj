Try more specific or alternative phrasings.\n2. **Check Information Extraction**: Did the search results contain the answer? If yes, identify where the agent failed to notice or use it. If no, the queries need to be reformulated.\n3. **Fix Reasoning Chain**: Trace the logic from search results to the final answer. Look for incorrect assumptions, confusion between similar entities, or missing logical steps.\n4. **Verify Answer Format**: Ensure the answer is placed inside <answer>...</answer> tags and is concise (e.g., a name, date, or short phrase — not a full sentence).\n5. **Try Different Angles**: If direct search failed, try searching for related entities, events, or alternative formulations of the question.\n",
