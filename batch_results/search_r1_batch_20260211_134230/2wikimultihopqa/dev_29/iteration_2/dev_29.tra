For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Are Fire In Hell and The Tiger: An Old Hunter'S Tale from the same country?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  Apply a DFS traversal to explore all possible combinations of strings, pruning branches that do not lead to a valid solution. Use a hash map to store the countries and their corresponding stories to avoid duplicates. The expected Time Complexity is O(2^N) and Space Complexity is O(N), where N is the number of input strings.\n"
