For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Are Fire In Hell and The Tiger: An Old Hunter'S Tale from the same country?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  Use Dynamic Programming to build up a solution by solving smaller subproblems and combining their results. A hash map is used to store the countries and their corresponding stories to ensure uniqueness. The expected Time Complexity is O(N^2) and Space Complexity is O(N), where N is the number of input strings.\n"
