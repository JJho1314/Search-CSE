The only goal is correctness — producing an answer that exactly matches\nthe ground truth. Analyze why the previous attempt failed and fix it.\n\nCommon failure modes:\n- **Wrong Search Queries**: The queries did not find the relevant information needed to answer the question.\n- **Missed Key Information**: The search returned useful results but the agent failed to extract the critical fact.\n- **Reasoning Error**: The agent found relevant information but drew an incorrect conclusion.\n- **Format Error**: The agent knew the answer but did not format it correctly in <answer>...</answer> tags.\nIdentify which category applies, then focus your fix accordingly.\n\n### SOURCE TRAJECTORY SUMMARY\n  iter1_sol14\n  label: iter1_sol14\n  solution:\n  ```\n  <think>\n  - The question asks if \"Fire In Hell\" and \"The Tiger: An Old Hunter's Tale\" are from the same country.\n  - I need to find out the countries of origin for both books.\n  </think>\n  <search>Fire In Hell, The Tiger: An Old Hunter's Tale</search>\n\n  <think>\n  - I found information about both books, but no direct mention of their countries of origin.\n  </think>\n  <search>countries of origin for Fire In Hell, The Tiger: An Old Hunter's Tale</search>\n\n  <think>\n  - The search results mention that \"Fire In Hell\" is a novel by Charlaine Harris, who is American, and \"The Tiger: An Old Hunter's Tale\" is a book by Laurence Hill, who is Canadian.\n  </think>\n  <search>nationality of Charlaine Harris, Laurence Hill</search>\n\n  <think>\n  - I have confirmed that Charlaine Harris is American and Laurence Hill is Canadian.\n  </think>\n  <search>is American and Canadian the same country?</search>\n\n  <think>\n  - I have confirmed that American and Canadian are different countries.\n  </think>\n  <answer> No </answer>\n  ```\n  metric: 0.0\n  summary:\n    solution_name: multi_hop_v2\n    approach_summary: The agent started by searching for information about the books and their authors, then determined the countries of origin for each author",
