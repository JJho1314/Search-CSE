The agent analyzed each trajectory to understand the search queries, key information, reasoning quality, and answer quality, then synthesized these insights to produce a correct answer.\n    search_queries:\n      - <search>Fire In Hell, The Tiger: An Old Hunter's Tale</search>\n      - <search>Charlaine Harris, Laurence Hill</search>\n      - <search>country of Charlaine Harris, country of Laurence Hill</search>\n    reasoning_quality: Logical and efficient, as the agent carefully searched for the necessary information and used it to reach a conclusion.\n    answer_quality: Correct, the final answer directly addresses the question.\n    key_learnings: Effective search strategies involve breaking down the question into smaller parts, searching for relevant information, and then using that information to reason towards the final answer. Combining insights from multiple attempts can improve the overall reasoning and answer quality.\n  iteration: 7\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: No\n    ground_truth:\n      - yes\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: False\n    subem_match: False\n    failure_reason: Answer 'No' does not match any of ['yes']\n  source_entry_labels:\n    - iter1_sol6\n    - iter1_sol5\n  operator_name: crossover\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\n### REFINEMENT GUIDELINES\n1. **Diagnose Search Quality**: Review the search queries used. Did they target the right entities and relationships? Were they too broad or too narrow? Try more specific or alternative phrasings.\n2. **Check Information Extraction**: Did the search results contain the answer? If yes, identify where the agent failed to notice or use it. If no, the queries need to be reformulated.\n3. **Fix Reasoning Chain**: Trace the logic from search results to the final answer. Look for incorrect assumptions, confusion between similar entities, or missing logical steps.\n4. **Verify Answer Format**: Ensure the answer is placed inside <answer>...</answer> tags and is concise (e.g., a name, date, or short phrase — not a full sentence).\n5. **Try Different Angles**: If direct search failed, try searching for related entities, events, or alternative formulations of the question.\n",
