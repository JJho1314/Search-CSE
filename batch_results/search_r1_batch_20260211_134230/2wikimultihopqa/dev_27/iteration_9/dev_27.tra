After reasoning, if you find you lack some knowledge, you can call a search engine by <search> query </search> and it will return the top searched results between <information> and </information>. You can search as many times as you want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Who is the spouse of the director of film Eden And After?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: CROSSOVER STRATEGY\nYou are given two previous search-and-reasoning attempts at answering a factual question.\nNeither produced the correct answer. Your task is to combine the best search strategies\nand reasoning from both attempts to produce a correct answer.\n\nAnalyze each trajectory to understand:\n- Which search queries found useful information and which did not\n- What relevant facts each attempt discovered\n- Where each attempt's reasoning went wrong\n- Whether either attempt was close to the correct answer\n\n### TRAJECTORY 1 SUMMARY\n  iter1_sol3\n  label: iter1_sol3\n  solution:\n  ```\n  <think>\n  1. I need to find out who directed the film \"Eden And After\".\n  2.

The agent effectively used the search results to form a clear line of reasoning.\n    answer_quality: Correct.

This is a simple and straightforward approach that effectively addresses the question.\n    search_queries:\n      -\n        query: Who is the director of the film Eden And After?\n        effectiveness: Effective. Found relevant information about the director Yael Hersonski.\n      -\n        query: Who is the spouse of Yael Hersonski?\n        effectiveness: Effective. Found relevant information about the spouse Rina Siboni.\n    reasoning_quality: Logical and consistent. The agent's reasoning steps clearly follow the required information gathering and linking process.\n    answer_quality: Inaccurate. The final answer 'Rina Siboni' does not match the ground truth ['Catherine Robbe-Grillet'].\n    key_learnings: For this type of question, it is important to ensure that the search queries are precise and that the final answer matches the ground truth. A more thorough search or verification step might be necessary to ensure accuracy.\n  iteration: 6\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Rina Siboni\n    ground_truth:\n      - Catherine Robbe-Grillet\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: False\n    subem_match: False\n    failure_reason: Answer 'Rina Siboni' does not match any of ['Catherine Robbe-Grillet']\n  source_entry_labels:\n    - iter1_sol2\n  operator_name: reflection_refine\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\n### SYNTHESIS GUIDELINES\n1. **Combine Search Strategies**: Use the most effective search queries from both attempts. If T1 found relevant context about one aspect and T2 about another, combine both pieces of evidence.\n2. **Cross-validate Reasoning**: If both attempts reached different conclusions, use the search results from both to determine which reasoning chain is more supported by evidence.\n3. **Fill Knowledge Gaps**: If T1 missed a key fact that T2 found (or vice versa), ensure the combined approach uses all discovered information.\n4. **Avoid Shared Errors**: If both attempts made the same reasoning mistake, you MUST try a fundamentally different search approach or reasoning strategy for that part.\n5. **Produce Clean Answer**: The final answer should be a single, well-supported response inside <answer>...</answer> tags, backed by evidence from the combined search results.\n"
