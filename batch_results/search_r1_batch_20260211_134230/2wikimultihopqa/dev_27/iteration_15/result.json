The only goal is correctness — producing an answer that exactly matches\n  the ground truth. Analyze why the previous attempt failed and fix it.\n\n  Common failure modes:\n  - **Wrong Search Queries**: The queries did not find the relevant information needed to answer the question.\n  - **Missed Key Information**: The search returned useful results but the agent failed to extract the critical fact.\n  - **Reasoning Error**: The agent found relevant information but drew an incorrect conclusion.\n  - **Format Error**: The agent knew the answer but did not format it correctly in <answer>...</answer> tags.\n  Identify which category applies, then focus your fix accordingly.\n\n  ### SOURCE TRAJECTORY SUMMARY\n    iter1_sol1\n    label: iter1_sol1\n    solution:\n    ```\n    <think>\n    The question asks for the spouse of the director of the film \"Eden And After\".\n    </think>\n    <search>Who is the director of the film Eden And After?</search>\n\n    <information>\n    Director: Yael Hersonski\n    </information>\n\n    <think>\n    I know the director of \"Eden And After\" is Yael Hersonski.\n    </think>\n    <search>Who is the spouse of Yael Hersonski?</search>\n\n    <information>\n    Spouse: Rina Siboni\n    </information>\n\n    <think>\n    I know the director of \"Eden And After\" is Yael Hersonski and his spouse is Rina Siboni.\n    </think>\n    <answer> Rina Siboni </answer>\n    ```\n    metric: 0.0\n    summary:\n      solution_name: direct_search\n      approach_summary: The agent used a direct search strategy, starting with searching for the director of the film 'Eden And After' and then searching for the spouse of that director.
