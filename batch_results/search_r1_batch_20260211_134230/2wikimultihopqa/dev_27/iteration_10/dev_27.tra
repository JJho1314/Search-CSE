This approach effectively addressed the question by directly finding the necessary information.\n    search_queries:\n      - <search>Director of film Eden And After</search>\n      - <search>Spouse of Michael Hoffman</search>\n    reasoning_quality: Logical and effective. The agent's reasoning steps clearly followed the required information gathering and linking process.\n    answer_quality: Correct. The final answer 'Kristi Zea' directly addresses the question and matches the ground truth.\n    key_learnings: For this type of question, a direct search for relevant details followed by a direct connection to the final answer is an effective strategy. It's crucial to ensure the search queries are precise and the final answer matches the ground truth.\n  iteration: 9\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Kristi Zea\n    ground_truth:\n      - Catherine Robbe-Grillet\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: False\n    subem_match: False\n    failure_reason: Answer 'Kristi Zea' does not match any of ['Catherine Robbe-Grillet']\n  source_entry_labels:\n    - iter1_sol3\n    - iter1_sol6\n  operator_name: crossover\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\n### REFINEMENT GUIDELINES\n1. **Diagnose Search Quality**: Review the search queries used. Did they target the right entities and relationships? Were they too broad or too narrow? Try more specific or alternative phrasings.\n2. **Check Information Extraction**: Did the search results contain the answer? If yes, identify where the agent failed to notice or use it. If no, the queries need to be reformulated.\n3. **Fix Reasoning Chain**: Trace the logic from search results to the final answer. Look for incorrect assumptions, confusion between similar entities, or missing logical steps.\n4. **Verify Answer Format**: Ensure the answer is placed inside <answer>...</answer> tags and is concise (e.g., a name, date, or short phrase \u2014 not a full sentence).\n5. **Try Different Angles**: If direct search failed, try searching for related entities, events, or alternative formulations of the question.\n"
