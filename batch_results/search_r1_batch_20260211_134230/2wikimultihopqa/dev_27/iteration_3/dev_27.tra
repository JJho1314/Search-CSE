You can search as many times as you want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.\n\nQuestion: Who is the spouse of the director of film Eden And After?\n\n### STRATEGY MODE: PLAN STRATEGY\nYou must strictly follow and implement the outlined approach below.\n\n  Create a graph where nodes represent directors and edges represent films directed by them. Use a breadth-first search (BFS) to traverse the graph starting from the director of the film Eden And After. Keep track of visited directors to avoid cycles. When the director's spouse is found, return their name. Time Complexity: O(n + e), where n is the number of directors and e is the number of films. Space Complexity: O(n).\n"
