Use a breadth-first search (BFS) to traverse the graph starting from the director of the film Eden And After. Keep track of visited directors to avoid cycles. When the director's spouse is found, return their name. Time Complexity: O(n + e), where n is the number of directors and e is the number of films. Space Complexity: O(n).\n",
