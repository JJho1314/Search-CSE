This approach allowed the agent to gather necessary information in two steps to find the correct answer.\n    search_queries:\n      - <search>director of film Eden And After</search>\n      - <search>spouse of Timur Bekmambetov</search>\n    reasoning_quality: Logical and effective. The reasoning chain followed a clear step-by-step approach to find the necessary information.\n    answer_quality: The final answer 'Natalya Beloglazova' matches the question 'Who is the spouse of the director of film Eden And After?'\n    key_learnings: Effective use of multi-hop queries to gather information in steps can be a useful strategy when dealing with questions that require additional information beyond the initial query.\n  iteration: 1\n  artifacts:\n    extracted_answer: Natalya Beloglazova\n    ground_truth:\n      - Catherine Robbe-Grillet\n    data_source: 2wikimultihopqa\n    em_match: False\n    subem_match: False\n    failure_reason: Answer 'Natalya Beloglazova' does not match any of ['Catherine Robbe-Grillet']\n  source_entry_labels:\n\n  operator_name: plan\n  meta:\n    summary_enabled: True\n\n### REFINEMENT GUIDELINES\n1. **Diagnose Search Quality**: Review the search queries used. Did they target the right entities and relationships? Were they too broad or too narrow? Try more specific or alternative phrasings.\n2. **Check Information Extraction**: Did the search results contain the answer? If yes, identify where the agent failed to notice or use it. If no, the queries need to be reformulated.\n3. **Fix Reasoning Chain**: Trace the logic from search results to the final answer. Look for incorrect assumptions, confusion between similar entities, or missing logical steps.\n4. **Verify Answer Format**: Ensure the answer is placed inside <answer>...</answer> tags and is concise (e.g., a name, date, or short phrase \u2014 not a full sentence).\n5. **Try Different Angles**: If direct search failed, try searching for related entities, events, or alternative formulations of the question.\n"
