Your task is to combine the best search strategies\nand reasoning from both attempts to produce a correct answer.\n\nAnalyze each trajectory to understand:\n- Which search queries found useful information and which did not\n- What relevant facts each attempt discovered\n- Where each attempt's reasoning went wrong\n- Whether either attempt was close to the correct answer\n\n### TRAJECTORY 1 SUMMARY\n  iter1_sol6\n  label: iter1_sol6\n  solution:\n  ```\n  ### STRATEGY MODE: REFLECTION AND REFINE STRATEGY\n  Your previous attempt at answering a factual question using search and reasoning did not produce\n  the correct answer. The only goal is correctness \u2014 producing an answer that exactly matches\n  the ground truth. Analyze why the previous attempt failed and fix it.\n\n  Common failure modes:\n  - **Wrong Search Queries**: The queries did not find the relevant information needed to answer the question.\n  - **Missed Key Information**: The search returned useful results but the agent failed to extract the critical fact.\n  - **Reasoning Error**: The agent found relevant information but drew an incorrect conclusion.\n  - **Format Error**: The agent knew the answer but did not format it correctly in <answer>...</answer> tags.\n  Identify which category applies, then focus your fix accordingly.\n\n  ### SOURCE TRAJECTORY SUMMARY\n    iter1_sol1\n    label: iter1_sol1\n    solution:\n    ```\n    <think>\n    1.
