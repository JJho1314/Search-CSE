However, the provided information does not directly state who Mary of France's mother is. But based on the given details, we can infer that Mary of France's mother is the maternal grandmother of Charles, Duke of Orléans, and subsequently, the paternal grandmother of Marie Zéphyrine of France.\n\nGiven the complexity and the lack of direct information about Mary of France's mother, it's challenging to pinpoint Marie Zéphyrine of France's paternal grandmother specifically from the provided search results. However, we can trace the lineage back to Louis XII of France and Mary of France, understanding that Mary of France's mother would be the answer to our query.", "iteration_index": 2, "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 985, "completion_tokens": 342, "total_tokens": 1327}}

At the death of her brother, Louis Alexandre de Bourbon-Penthi\\u00e8vre, \\\"\\\"prince de Lamballe\\\"\\\", she became the wealthiest heiress in France prior to the French Revolution.
