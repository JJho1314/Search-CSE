Your task is to combine the best search strategies\nand reasoning from both attempts to produce a correct answer.\n\nAnalyze each trajectory to understand:\n- Which search queries found useful information and which did not\n- What relevant facts each attempt discovered\n- Where each attempt's reasoning went wrong\n- Whether either attempt was close to the correct answer\n\n### TRAJECTORY 1 SUMMARY\n  iter1_sol14\n  label: iter1_sol14\n  solution:\n  ```\n  ### STRATEGY MODE: REFLECTION AND REFINE STRATEGY\n  Your previous attempt at answering a factual question using search and reasoning did not produce\n  the correct answer. The only goal is correctness \u2014 producing an answer that exactly matches\n  the ground truth. Analyze why the previous attempt failed and fix it.\n\n  Common failure modes:\n  - **Wrong Search Queries**: The queries did not find the relevant information needed to answer the question.\n  - **Missed Key Information**: The search returned useful results but the agent failed to extract the critical fact.\n  - **Reasoning Error**: The agent found relevant information but drew an incorrect conclusion.\n  - **Format Error**: The agent knew the answer but did not format it correctly in <answer>...</answer> tags.\n  Identify which category applies, then focus your fix accordingly.\n\n  ### SOURCE TRAJECTORY SUMMARY\n    iter1_sol10\n    label: iter1_sol10\n    solution:\n    ```\n    <think>\n    I need to find who is Marie Z\u00e9phyrine of France's paternal grandmother.\n    </think>\n    <search>paternal grandmother of Marie Z\u00e9phyrine of France</search>\n\n    ### Search Results:\n    - Marie Z\u00e9phyrine of France was the daughter of Louis Albert of Orl\u00e9ans and his wife, Margaret of Savoy.\n    - Louis Albert of Orl\u00e9ans was the son of Antoine of Orl\u00e9ans and his wife, Marie of Lorraine.\n    - Antoine of Orl\u00e9ans was the son of Louis II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans and his wife, Blanche of Navarre.\n\n    <think>\n    I know that Marie Z\u00e9phyrine of France's father is Louis Albert of Orl\u00e9ans, so I need to find out who his mother is.\n    </think>\n    <search>mother of Louis Albert of Orl\u00e9ans</search>\n\n    ### Search Results:\n    - Louis Albert of Orl\u00e9ans was the son of Antoine of Orl\u00e9ans and his wife, Marie of Lorraine.\n    - Antoine of Orl\u00e9ans was the son of Louis II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans and his wife, Blanche of Navarre.\n\n    <think>\n    I know that Louis Albert of Orl\u00e9ans' mother is Marie of Lorraine, so I need to find out who her mother is.\n    </think>\n    <search>mother of Marie of\n  ```\n  metric: 0.0\n  summary:\n    solution_name: entity_chain\n    approach_summary: The agent used a methodical approach to construct a chain of entities from Marie Z\u00e9phyrine of France's family tree.
