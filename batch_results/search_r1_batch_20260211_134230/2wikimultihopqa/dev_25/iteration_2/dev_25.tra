At the death of her brother, Louis Alexandre de Bourbon-Penthi\u00e8vre, \"\"prince de Lamballe\"\", she became the wealthiest heiress in France prior to the French Revolution. She married Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans, the \"\"regicide\"\" \"\"Philippe \u00c9galit\u00e9\"\", and was the mother of France's last king, Louis Philippe I, King of the French.

After considering the possibility of such a marriage, Louis XV and his chief minister, Cardinal Fleury, decided against it because this union would have brought the House of Orl\u00e9ans too close to the throne. In 1743, his paternal grandmother, Fran\u00e7oise-Marie de Bourbon the formidable Dowager Duchess of Orl\u00e9ans, and Louise \u00c9lisabeth, Dowager Princess of Conti arranged his marriage to his seventeen-year-old cousin, Louise Henriette de Bourbon (1726\u20131759), a member of the House of Bourbon-Conti, another cadet branch of the House of Bourbon. It was hoped this marriage would close a fifty-year-old family rift. Louis Philippe's father,\nDoc 3(Title: \"Louise Henriette de Bourbon\") was a grandson of Louis XIV. The latter is a direct male line descendant of Philip I, Duke of Orleans - a younger brother of Louis XIV and the ancestor of Louise Henriette's husband. This study established that no non-paternity event happened along the three studied in-depth paternal lineages of these living donors, thus discounting rumors that the branch of Bourbon-Orleans could be illegitimate. The couple had three children: Louise Henriette died on 9 February 1759 at age 32, with her husband and children at her side, at the Palais-Royal, the Orl\u00e9ans residence in Paris.
